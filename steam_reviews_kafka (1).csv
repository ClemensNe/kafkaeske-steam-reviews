[b]Take your anticipated oddness. Double it. Swirl in boldness in a 1:1 ratio.[/b] I usually take my tea and coffee black, but I'll make an exception for you, Hitchhiker.

It's certainly odd to think of that Humble Bundle Original from 2018 - the 'First Ride Prototype' - and how it's grown into this mini-epic vehicle for storytelling. [b]One that sees you planted firmly in that passenger seat, expected to listen.[/b]

At its heart it's a binary dialogue point-and-click adventure game. Mostly the former with some light puzzling. And it may all sound strangely limited. Five rides for which to simply lean back and set your brain to 'info assimilation mode.' [b]Surely there must be more?[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467243540

[b]But it honestly feels bold for it.[/b] Narrative set loose, free of the anxiety to compromise its mode of delivery and interactivity, Hitchhiker is quite interesting in its expectations of the player. Literal vehicles for storytelling with delivery straight to your earholes.

[b]Of course, it's more than that.[/b] There's the inspiration of Thirty Flights of Loving and Virginia here in creative use of camera angles. Interactive segments can be thoughtful and make you consider the greater meaning, like the simple act of tuning into someone's language on the radio.

[b]Hitchhiker is at its absolute best when it suddenly slips/phases in its weirdness.[/b] Listening to someone monologue at length will naturally precondition you to acceptance, nodding away until you realise your driver just said he once slipped through the cracks of an escalator. Are objects doubling up around me? It's that preternatural undercurrent to proceedings that really makes Hitchhiker's philosophical proddings shine. Stories based on Franz Kafka, historical Gulag events, and refugee experiences are all almost hypnotically absorbing.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467243669

[b]Excellent writing is bolstered by excellent performances.[/b] Having to move on to the next driver inherently makes you suspicious after you've just become attached to your current one, but on and on you find a new favourite. Their unique voices, both literally and in their perspectives and stories are all simply ace.

[b]Slightly less interesting is the overarching mystery.[/b] I for one actually appreciate that it concluded subtly. Better than being heavy-handed with earth-shattering revelations that then fall flat after all. Still, it's very clearly not the highlight here and every time little titbits are teased throughout I was annoyed at the distraction. Too much teasing leads to a fifth and final ride which can only disappoint. 

[b]Hitchhiker is also certainly not a technical knockout.[/b] Style? Sure. I think its excellent smudged, dreamy oil painting visuals work best when not in motion. It all feels decidedly creaky with its animations, awkward cuts between voice lines abound, etc. Some of the art for the side stories on the other hand leap off the screen with their quality. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2467243565

[b]Hitchhiker's brief, but compelling ride in its storytelling vehicles is as bold as it is gloriously odd. Simple acts of sitting, listening, and observing are memorable, if not its overarching plot and technical presentation to nearly the same extent. Niche it might well be, but consider me hitched rather than taking a hike.[/b]

Ghostly enemies don't die after being shot without a few extra stabs; spidery creatures attack you at extremely high speed; enemies spawn next to you out of nowhere; some parts of the map destroy you just for walking there. By the second mission I was being shot at by an assailant I could not even locate. There is no rational pattern to how the enemies behave or way to predict what is about to happen.

You'll need to be 100% accurate on all movements. The control system is clunky and unnatural; it is common to do the wrong action or even drop a weapon. I played all the way through Half-Life: Alyx and can't remember seriously bungling a reload; here I was fumbling to load a pistol before being discovered by the next enemy.

None of this was fun, exciting, or even challenging in a structured way. The dour Russian environment seems to have permeated the gameplay as well; it is clear that life in the Radius will be nothing but a Kafkaesque grind.

Zaten MW serisi birçok başarısıyla bence klasikler arasına çoktan girmiş durumda. Özellikle serinin ilk iki oyunu olan MW 1 ve MW 2'yi kendi başlarına bile FPS'nin zirve oyunları arasında sayıyorum.

Öncelikle grafiklerde önceki oyuna göre bariz hissedebileceğiniz iyileştirmeler var. Bölümlerin her biri kendine ait belirgin farklılıklara sahip. Sürekli başka bir ortamdasınız ve aksiyondan aksiyona koşturuyorsunuz. Dünyanın dört bir yanında savaş veriyorsunuz. Afganistan sokakları, Kazakistan dağları, Rusya'da bir havalimanı, Brezilya favelaları, ABD şehirleri, Pasifik'teki bir petrol platformu, Sibirya'daki maksimum güvenlikli bir hapishane, Beyaz Saray, Kafkasya, Afganistan çölleri... Gördüğünüz gibi MW 2 savaşı her türlü alana yaymış durumda.

MW 2'nin hikayeye getirdiği en büyük iki yenilik var. Birincisi ilk oyunda ana karakterimiz olan ve daha önce yüzünü hiç görmediğimiz Soap'u bu oyunda artık komutanımız olarak kanlı canlı görebiliyoruz. Hatta ilerleyen bölümlerde eskisi gibi kullanabiliyoruz da. Yeni olarak ise Soap'un komutasındaki Task Force 141'in bir üyesi olan Roach karakteriyle oynuyoruz. U.S. Army Ranger safında oynadığımız karakterin ismi ise Pvt. James Ramirez. İkinci yenilik ise kuşkusuz en büyüğü: Makarov. MW serisindeki asıl baş belamız ilk defa bu oyunda karşımıza çıkıyor. Kendisi ilk oyundaki Imran Zakhaev'in ardılı.

Bu oyunda MW 1'den farklı olarak ilk defa Special Ops özelliğini görüyoruz. Tek başına bazen sıkıcı olabiliyorken co-op girilirse hayli eğlenceli hale gelebilen bir eklenti olmuş. Kendinize arkadaş bulamıyorsanız bunun için toplulukta gerekli başlıklar açılmış. Gönderi atarsanız mutlaka birilerinden geri dönüş oluyor.

CoD'u her zaman hikayesi için oynadığımdan multiplayer ile ilgili pek bir bilgim yok. Ama yabancı yorumlarda ciddi sıkıntılar olduğundan bahsediliyor. MW 1'in multiplayerını aratıyormuş.

Sonuç olarak MW 2, ilk oyunun hikayede bıraktığı yerden seriyi alıp yine üst düzey bir şekilde işlemiş ve efsaneleşmiş bir oyun. Seriyi daha da hareketlendirerek bize yepyeni maceralar sunmuş, önceki oyundan aklımızda kalan soru işaretlerinin çoğunu gidermiştir. MW 1 gibi MW 2 de tavsiyenin ötesinde bence her oyuncunun mutlaka oynaması gereken bir başyapıt.",1264,turkish

You know how some games claim to be “Kafkaesque”? Well this title is literal Kafka, something which the uncrowned Master of Absurd would definitely have been proud, if not for his crippling shyness and desire to destroy his own writings. More on a that a bit later. For now let’s focus on Metamorphosis, the video game adaptation. As the second Steam project to date for developer Ovid Works, they certainly made a bold choice when compared to their debut, a VR-exclusive that was a rather tame Cold War spoof. “Interkosmos” does share the DNA of absurdity with Metamorphosis, so I regard it as a natural progression towards more mature themes. All In! Games took a chance with this publishing, yet I am certain that it paid off considering the title at hand.

[h1]Story [/h1]
Before we’ll dig into the adaptation itself, I want to discuss the unique source material since Franz Kafka manages to puzzle his readers to this day. Not a prolific writer and certainly not one to bask into any spotlight notion of fame, Kafka didn’t live long enough to see the majority of his writings published. In fact, were it up to his final wishes upon deathbed, we wouldn’t be aware of his literary existence at all. He wanted his entire life’s work burnt to a crisp but his closest acquaintances refused. With friends like these, who needs enemies? The few writings published during his lifetime didn’t attract any critical or commercial attention. 1915’s “The Metamorphosis” is one such failed attempt at breaking the mold upon release. It serves as the bedrock for this video game, yet there is another Kafka novel which left its own mark of distinction upon our adventure. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2254107053 

Published one year after its author’s untimely demise, 1925’ “The Trial” is a culmination of the socio-bureaucratic absurdity which became Kafka’s signature subgenre. Serving more as social commentary than the wrongfully-attributed significance as an obscured political manifesto, imagine a mock trial in which you stand accused of crimes you won’t even become aware of, not to mention given a chance to properly defend yourself. Unwarranted hostility from cold institutions ran by people too blinded by archaic procedures. Our Metamorphosis adapted narrative threads from both the titular source material and Kafka’s Trial while managing to leave enough room for interpretation in regards to multiple endings.

It won’t matter if you read any of Kafka’s writings previously or not, the feeling of novelty will hit you like a brick wall. That is fully intended and in spite of being able to draw some comparisons to Lewis Carroll’s own fictional absurdities, Kafka’s insects are nowhere near as random as the ones found in “Alice's Adventures in Wonderland”. Players shall assume the role of Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman which gets mysteriously transformed into a bug. As if the situation wasn’t bad enough, Gregor will have to assist his friend Josef K, a bank clerk with inexplicable legal issues. Franz Kafka hated his job as an insurance agent since it was paradoxically inhibiting his hobby of writing in his “spare time”. Escapism through writing rings closer to home for me. The theme of being trapped in a meaningless existence with no clear escape from it, plays a central role in the game adaptation as well.

And yet Gregor will try to save his friend and also return to human form. The solution? Travel to the Tower, an all-powerful institution  which oversees most aspects of life within its gloomy insect world. The path ahead is treacherous as you can’t trust anybody. Least of which the state and its dreary employees, whose cushy jobs are merely an extension of their inherent corruption and ineptitude. Dark humor aplenty in Metamorphosis, as it finds more than a handful of metaphors on how bureaucracy can become a veritable cause of death. Even with its relatively linear structure, the game manages to offer several alternate choices along the way. These will influence the endings to a certain degree.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257837615

[h1]Graphics[/h1] 
In a rare instance for Unreal Engine 4, I had no issues performance-wise with it in Metamorphosis. It’s true, the “eye candy” is heavily filtered through assets which slightly resemble cel shading except there are no clearly defined outlines. This only enhances the surreal aspect of the game world without being very taxing on most systems. By dispensing with any sort of HUD, the title endeared itself to me as I was able to focus on capturing as many clean screenshots as I wished. You may have to move Gregor’s insect arms a bit since they get in the way, yet I find that aspect rather charming and immersive. Took over 100 screenshots and nearly half of those made the cut on my Steam profile. There will be plenty of sights to admire, bugs to interact and documents to inspect. There’s no point in rushing things.

 [h1]Audio[/h1]
An original soundtrack and spot on British accents further give the title an air of sophistication despite certain inaccuracies surrounding lip syncing. A minor issue which won’t really matter in the grand scheme of things, as Gregor loses his ability to sound coherently soon after his transformation. Josef and various human NPCs are still as intelligible as the situation warrants it, while all the insects use chitter as a means of communication. Gregor still manages to pronouce several words such as ""Tower"" and ""Certificate"". You'll get your fill of both terms in no time. Long live the subtitles, right?

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
At its heart, Metamorphosis might just be a story-driven 3D platformer from a first person perspective, yet that’s quite a mouthful so we’ll synthetize it as an unconventional adventure into institutional subconscious. You’ll be literally surfing on useless documents eventually. Nevermind the amount of jumping around and vertical climbing (with the help of glue or ink). Interaction with your fellow bugs is pretty straightforward and it usually results into fetch quests gone terribly wrong. Much like its source material, the game’s anything but  predictable. If you’re into collectibles, there are some “shrines” waiting to be demolished and they’re obviously hidden from plain sight and inserted into harder to reach spots on the maps. From my personal experience with Metamorphosis, you can involuntarily skip half those optional quests/interactions and still complete the story. If you want to see all the endings and get the rarest Steam Achievements for this title, you’ll have to replay its chapters. They’re easily accessible from the Main Menu and it’s a form of replay value, I guess.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2264233044

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Not that you’ll find many titles on the Steam Store paying homage to Kafka, yet Metamorphosis seems to have hit the sweet spot in terms of adapting the writer’s convoluted magnum opus to a modern audience, while also pleasing the old timers which read and are still puzzled about the true meaning behind Franz’ thoughts. To each their own, I’m certain that adventure fans can enjoy Metamorphosis regardless of their eventual conclusions. You can checkout anytime you like, but you can never leave!

+ Steam Achievements.
+ Beautiful graphics & sounds.
+ Finest Kafka adaptation to date.

For most people, Metamorphosis is a fine and effective adventure-platformer, with the core conceit that the player character is an insect. Movement and jumping are snappy and responsive, the levels are brilliantly designed, and the writing and characters are quite excellent. If you are unfamiliar with the source material, the game is still mighty fine in every regard it strives to be.

If, however, you are a total book nerd who devoured every Kafka collected edition, have practically memorized the scenes in The Trial, and own hardback copies of every Peter Kuper adaptation of Franz Kafka's work (shut up, I like books), then Metamorphosis is an absolute dream come true. I won't spoil much, as the game's narrative works best going in as blind as possible, but for those expecting a direct adaptation, this is not it (that game came out a bit of a while back as a point and click adventure). Rather, Metamorphosis is more a celebration of Kafka's works and themes, vaunting his absurdist and surrealist style while lamenting the crippling horror of the mundane. Characters and scenes from across his entire bibliography appear, translated beautifully into an interactive medium.

The protagonist is called Gregor. One morning, he woke up from the bed, not knowing where he was. It took about a few seconds before he finally remembered it. It turned out that they drank too much last night because of their friend’s birthday, and they are now boarding at the house of their good friend Joseph. He felt that he was awake enough to confirm that he could walk normally. He decided to take a look at Joseph's condition before going to work. When he took the key to open the door, strange things happened. The corridor seemed to have changed. Although he often came to Joseph’s house, he had no impression of the scene. When he opened the next door, something stranger happened-he suddenly became a short and small beetle, and the surrounding scene seemed so huge in front of him, as if he was about to swallow him. Before he could figure out what happened to him, he accidentally discovered that his good friend Joseph had been arrested by the police again for something. [b]In order to find a way to save his friends, and to find a way to restore his human body shape, he started this magical adventure from the perspective of a beetle.[/b]

[h1]Playability[/h1]
1: Including the prologue, there are a total of 8 levels. Players will explore 7 scenes with different characteristics from the first-person perspective of the beetle. Through these levels, there is no fixed route (free exploration), the player can reach the destination in any way (as long as this method works).
2: In addition to completing the main tasks/puzzles in the area to promote the plot, players can also help those NPCs who need help to complete secondary puzzles/tasks, which can unlock achievements and understand through dialogue with them to learn more about this world.
3: Each scene contains a secret, which is equivalent to the collection part, but there is no display or record after acquisition.

This is an on-line process. Players only need to follow the tower signs to move forward. There is no need to worry about getting lost or finding the direction. There is a hint in the game, and the eye symbol on the map is the target location. In addition to the main line, there are also some branch lines, but strictly speaking, they are not considered as branch lines. Firstly, they do not have any rewards. Secondly, they have no influence on the plot. At most, they will reward players for achievements. For players who love to unlock achievements, it may be very attractive. As for the puzzle solving and collection part, let’s talk about solving puzzles first. The amount of puzzle solving in the game is a little bit small. Compared to solving puzzles, parkour's gameplay seems to be more prominent, and players can even start speedrun challenges.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
Low FOV creates a better sense of substitution, but it may also cause discomfort.
The rotation of the lens and the feel of the control are as smooth as silk, and the loading response speed is also very fast.
With hints on the map, basically you won’t get stuck when playing.

[h1]CONS[/h1]
The puzzle design is a bit disappointing. Most of the time, it is based on simple parkour, which is not worthy of such exquisite scene modeling.
The process is short, even if it is the first time to explore slowly, it will take up to 4 hours or so.

[b]This work gave me a novel experience from the beginning. During the period, the operations like turning off the electric fan, turning the valve and signing the stamp are also very substituting. During the game, it is not easy to feel boring, like a music box club. The exquisite internal structure of other facilities is even more breathtaking. In general, it is recommended to try, but considering that the process is not long, it is recommended to start rationally.[/b]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
Metamorphosis is an adventure-puzzle-platformer made by Ovid Works and published by All In! Games focused on the homonymous original story by writer Franz Kafka, “The Metamorphosis”.
You play as Gregor, a human turned into a bug, who embarks on a journey to find out how and why he was transformed while also trying to help get his friend Joseph out of a big problem.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay is very simple and straightforward. The first few minutes as a human you basically just walk until you get transformed into an insect. Then, in order to solve the various puzzles and advance through the story, you walk/run, jump and climb objects and walls using sticky substances strategically placed near the surfaces that you need to climb. 

Basically, all your actions are being “hinted” throughout the game and the puzzles are very straightforward which makes this game quite easy to complete while there are really no side missions apart from the main story.
[8/10]

[h1]Story:[/h1]
[b]*May contain spoilers*[/b]
Anyone who has read the original story, *The Metamorphosis*, written by the famous author Franz Kafka will be familiar with the events that take place. This game is most certainly focusing entirely on this original story. 

You firstly start out as a human in a room while you are over at your friend Joseph’s place. While wandering around looking for your friend you realize that you have been transformed in an ant-like insect. The “people” who transformed you, have also arrested your friend Joseph and demand that you go to *The Tower* where you will have the chance to become human again.

The path to *The Tower* is where most of the events of the story happen. At this point the game becomes a walking simulator where you are following sigils that reveal the path to *The Tower* while also meeting one insect after the other to unveil the next objectives and finally turn on *The Projections* which is the way to get to the tower.

After finding your way to the top of the tower, you finally meet with the chief of the insects who gives you a dilemma, you prosecute your friend Joseph as guilty, which basically means that he gets executed, or you can never become human again. After finding a workaround, which involves taking the whole tower down, you end up in the same room as the one you started out and you are no longer an insect. The story ends after opening the only door of the room and the same people that arrested your friend now come to probably arrest you this time. After this, your fate is probably getting arrested but this time no tiny insect will help you. This ultimately means that you will end up being executed for your past actions.
[9.5/10]

[h1]Graphics/Audio:[/h1]
Metamorphosis has high quality textures and vivid colors where it is due. It isn’t what we call *the bleeding edge of graphics* but it still looks pretty nice. It has both well lit environments and dim/dark underground places. Using AMD FidelityFX technology, the game gets a better HDR look which emphasizes the transitions from well lit to dark places. Animations aren’t exactly top notch but are fairly consistent.

Audio is high fidelity, sound effects are correctly matched to the actions on-screen and background music is matching the whole atmosphere of the game very nicely. 

Voice acting is mostly good for human characters but when it comes to voice acting the insect characters, who play the biggest role of the two in the events, if it wasn’t for subtitles you wouldn’t be able to make out the sentences.
[9/10]

[h1]Performance:[/h1]
[i]Tested on AMD Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ddr4 and GeForce GTX 960 4gb[/i]
Developed with the Unreal Engine, this game manages to look good while also having very good performance too. I was getting ~70 fps consistently with all the graphical settings maxed out, except of course for motion blur which I don’t personally like in almost every game.
[9.5/10]

[h1]Price:[/h1]
While I really liked this game, it being so short is definitely a factor to consider and I can’t really justify spending the full price of around 20 euros for just 3 hours of playtime for the main story and no extra content.
[6.5/10]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Metamorphosis started of as a thrilling and mysterious experience, especially for someone like me who hasn’t read the original story by Franz Kafka, but after *walking* for the most part of the short story and considering the steep price I can only recommend this game to those of you who don’t factor price as much, as it was still a nice experience at the end of the day.

Metamorphosis é um jogo que resgatou em seu âmago o grande e curioso conto de FRANZ KAFKA. Em temática e jogabilidade o game vai muito bem, é divertido, possui uma narrativa curiosa e um ritmo bacana que te prende do início ao fim. Ainda assim, nem tudo é um mar de rosas no jogo, e, o que poderia ser um game extremamente incrível, acaba sendo algo, mediano, o que, na minha opinião, estraga um pouco a imagem do que o belíssimo METAMORFOSE de FRANZ KAFKA significa.

O conto/romance em si conta a história de Gregor Samsa, um caixeiro viajante, que, em um certo dia vê que seu corpo agora era de um inseto. O conto abre as portas para discussões como, o medo, aceitação, ódio e repugnância, e de fato, o jogo INICIALMENTE aborda esses temas, de fora exemplar.

[h1] APENAS UM INSETO? [/h1]

De fato o jogo promove a ideia de uma exploração lúdica e extremamente criativa de um ser que se transformou em um inseto, mas, logo em seus primeiros momentos, o visual do jogo se parece ultrapassado. Visualmente o game não é dos melhores e não se destaca em aspecto algum, apesar de muito bem polido e acabado.

É incrível como o game tinha uma possibilidade absurda de desenvolver um visual mais único para os insetos, e, não somente isso, como também poderia aumentar mais ainda o visual ""grotesco"" que é trabalho por Kafka em sua obra. As pessoas tem nojo de insetos, mas, o mais importante, o ""medo"", ""ódio"", ""raiva"" que são trabalhados na obra original, só estão presentes nos primeiros 10 minutos de jogo. Depois disso, toda a tensão e dúvida vai-se por água abaixo e o jogo entra em um tipo de comédia sombria desagradável.

Porém, isso não faz do jogo ruim, na realidade, ele aborda de forma superficial esses temas durante a trama toda, o que pode ser um ponto positivo caso vocês tenha pessoas para discutir sobre, e, o mais importante, apreciar juntos essa jornada, que de fato,  tras uma sensação gostosa do começo ao fim, apesar de seus defeitos.

Dependendo do preço do jogo, recomendaria ele, e já deixo avisado, que mais de R$40,00 esse jogo com certeza não vale. Ainda mais com suas miseras 5 horas de duração, que, acredite, é mais que suficiente pro que ele tem a oferecer!",307,brazilian

[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? No, it is too kafkaesque for that. And it contains far too many bugs (not coding bugs, though). And maybe it is a bit short, although it took me a few hours. It is basically a first-person 3D puzzle platformer. You are transformed into a roach and have to reach the Tower to become human again. To be able to do this, you run, jump and climb through rooms in the real world as we know it, and through (fantasy) rooms behind/below/under that, where you meet other bugs. Avoid getting crushed, falling down, drowning, getting poisoned or otherwise killed, and don't loose your orientation. This can become a bit difficult when you climb nearly upside down. 

The main challenge of the game is to reach the next place to continue the story. Solve a few puzzles on the way, although most are not too difficult. The (mostly short) conversations with other bugs are quite funny, and some settings (like the Gramophone Club, the Harbour Town or the Construction Site) are very well fleshed out with dozens of characters to talk to. Bugville is so big, you can easily get lost. When in the real world, you have to listen to absolutely kafkaesque conversations of humans, some play in an endless loop (I really was close to killing the lawyer, but I instead turned off the volume). Gamepad support works perfect, 3440x1440 (ultrawidescreen) is also supported. 

I didn't have so much fun playing a bug since playing ""Bad Mojo"" (Pulse Entertainment) from 1996.

Franz Kafka (František Kafka) war ein junger Schriftsteller der 1883 geboren wurde und 1924 verstarb, wie bei vielen Berühmtheiten, wurden auch Franz Kafkas größte Werke erst nach seinem tot gewürdigt. 1912 schrieb der Schriftsteller sein Buch „Die Verwandlung“, die eine große Inspiration für das Spiel Metamorphosis war.

[h1][b]Zwischen Freundschaft, Verrat und Rätseln[/b][/h1]
Metamorphosis steckt wie schon erwähnt voller Abendteuer in der es viele Rätsel zu lösen gibt, die Rätsel selbst sind nicht wirklich schwer, aber manchmal der weg zu ihnen, vor allem mit unseren Insektenbeinen, die wir nicht gewohnt sind ... Tollpatschig wie im echten leben halt … wir müssen unserem Freund helfen und uns selbst, suchen dabei nach Lösungen, treffen andere Insekten, die ebenfalls unsere Hilfe benötigen, müssen Entscheidungen treffen die uns sogar bis hin zum verrat unseres besten Freundes führen können um am Ende dann doch irgendwie zu scheitern, denn selbst wenn es zwei Enden gibt, wird das Erwachen nüchtern.

[h1][b]Grafik und Musik[/b][/h1]
Die Grafik ist sehr schön, bizarr, manchmal gruselig und faszinierend, die Visuellen Effekte sind gelungen und die Musik nagelt den Wahnsinn in die Ohren. Besonders gut haben mir die Soundeffekte gefallen, die das Krabbeln simulieren, die Insektenstimmen dagegen haben mich an „Der Exorzismus“ erinnert, wobei manchmal die Stimmen nicht wirklich passten. Aber alles in allem empfand ich es doch sehr gelungen.

[h1][b]Fazit:[/b][/h1]
Bei meinem ersten Durchspielen habe ich für Metamorphosis ca. fünf Stunden gebraucht und das wahrscheinlich untypische Ende erreicht, ich ließ mir dabei aber immer Zeit alles anzusehen und zu bestaunen, ich habe mir sogar alle Flachwitze angehört, die ich teilweise sehr lustig fand. Überhaupt die Idee die in das Spiel geflossen sind, fand ich sehr cool umgesetzt, auch die Zitate von Franz Kafka. Die Story hätte aber gerne länger sein können und etwas ausführlicher. Nicht so gut haben mir die beiden Enden gefallen, die, wenn man ehrlich ist, nur eine Richtung erlauben. Egal wie wir uns entscheiden, das Ende bleibt ernüchternd. Ansonsten kann ich Metamorphosis an jeden empfehlen, der keine Insektenphobie hat, keine herausfordernden Rätsel sucht, sondern viel mehr eine Story erleben möchte die einen durch die krassen Virtuellen Effekte und Musik in den Wahnsinn treiben kann, bei dem man sich wie in einer abgedrehten Irrenanstalt fühlt und dennoch gut Unterhalten wird und das ein oder andere Grinsen nicht verstecken kann. Einzige Manko das ich noch hinzufügen möchte ist, dass der Preis ein wenig zu hoch gesetzt ist, das Spiel hat mich wirklich Positiv überrascht, dennoch empfinde ich einen Preis von 21€ etwas zu teuer. 30% bis 50% sind ein Top Preis.

Cogiendo elementos de la obra ""La metamorfosis"" de Kafka eres Gregorio. Un vendedor que se despierta y nota que poco a poco va empequeñeciendo hasta convertirse en un bicho. Desde esa perspectiva verá como su compañero de trabajo está metido en líos.

Con esa argumento tan original exploraremos entornos desde otra escala. Unos entornos inmensos y detallados pero por contra poco interactivos. A esto hay que sumar la poca variedad de bichos con los que podemos encontrarnos (practicamente solo tienen misma forma y diferentes color)

En la parte jugable el juego tiene solo 4 acciones (andar, saltar, correr y trepar) para todo el juego que pueden salvarlo de un walking simulator. Por no tener no tiene ni siquiera enemigos, jefe final u otro elemento que tenga una dificultad mayor.
Podría decirse que nos centraremos en calibrar el salto de un lado a otro y nos llevara 4 horas en terminarlo sin mucha prisa.

Me da coraje de que este juego falla en cosas tontísimas y da la sensación por el trailer y sus niveles que por presupuesto, tiempo o los que sea iba a ser un juego más ambicioso de lo que terminó siendo.

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I have not completed Metamorphosis. However, I have spent enough time with the game that I believe I am safe in writing a review.

Metamorphosis is one of the most unique games I've played. It is a first person adventure, played as an insect. Instead of seeing your hands, you see your front legs and instead of footsteps, you 'skittle' along surfaces. When you miss a jump and fall to the floor, the sound is unmistakable as the 'squish' of an insect death. From this perspective, exploring drawers, crevasses, desks, filing cabinets, and the spaces humans can only imagine is quite a change. Kudos to the development team for crafting such marvelous visuals for a view that they, themselves, have never experienced!

In terms of story, there are two threads that reflect the themes from Franz Kafka's works Metamorphosis and The Trial. Gregor, the man-turned-insect is exploring and listening to the saga of Josef K (who is attempting to navigate a faceless legal systeml).  Although you do not need to have read Kafka, those who have will recognize and enjoy a new take on classic stories.

While there are quality voice overs for the humans that appear, the insect conversations are done with a distortion that adds to your sense of being in a strange world. The sound track is definitely a plus in this game and headphones are a must.

My only caveat for players is that there is a lot of platforming moves required which become more difficult as the game progresses. You do a bit of jumping, running, leaping from one moving object to another, etc. If you miss then it is likely you will start the entire sequence again. While there are quite a few automatic save/check points, I would have liked to have been able to do an explicit save halfway through a difficult sequence. I played with the keyboard which worked better for me than a controller.

I highly recommend Metamorphosis if you are looking for an adventure with a twist. For those with good run/jump coordination, it should be an easy journey. For others, it may require some perseverance but the overall game experience is worth it.

Now... if I can only make this next jump...

Added Note: I finally made the jump and completed my journey. What a brilliant game!",1692,english

The game is a good lenght in my opinion - I finished it in ~4,5h after really taking my time to explore, then revisitet to collect achievements (it's an easy game to 100% too). It has light platform elements that weren't hard for me (but something to take note of if you detest anything platformer), you get to be a bug after all and they tend to climb and jump around a lot! 

A really really fun and good looking game that'll be an extra treat for any kafka fan. I'm still amazed at how perfect gregors room was designed - just to how I would imagine it!!",372,english

There are a lot of bugs in this game. ""Metamorphosis"" is not one of those games that make you fall in love from the very first second, but once you taste it, it is simply impossible to come off. A bizarre mix of several Kafkaesque pieces in which you have to find yourself in the role of a beetle that was just a man yesterday. The creators approached the very idea of metamorphosis very subtly, because even at the level of feelings of movement, what happened to the hero is felt. At first, the controls will seem very awkward and inconvenient, and only after a while you realize that this was done on purpose, in order to once again strengthen the connection between the core of the game and the player's mind, so that he himself felt in the body of an insect. And not just an insect, but a beetle, which yesterday did not have even the slightest idea how to organically move like insects, therefore today it moves like a small child taking its first steps. I just love it when developers bother so much about the details that make their games unique, and at the moment of understanding this message, I realized that I definitely really like the game.

The gameplay of the game resembles one of my favorite games of all time - ""Bad Mojo"". You are very small, and everything is very huge and strives to kill you, and in a small insect world, not everyone treats you with respect. That is, we are constantly solving big puzzles, the main goal of which will be - ""how to get on that huge book,"" or ""how to attract the attention of this huge man"", naturally mixed with Kafkaesque inventive madness. The gameplay leaves the most pleasant impression, even if the game is not long (it took me 3.5 hours), but due to the good variability in completing tasks, you can stretch it out even longer, and several different endings are also available. There is a hint system, and sometimes you had to use it, a few places are quite complicated.

 The creators have successfully understood the very essence of Kafka's statements, very competently dividing the semantic content of the game between caustic sarcasm, philosophicalism, some kind of recklessness of thoughts, creating an extremely interesting product. An unexpected discovery for me personally, my compliments.",216,english
0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"Honestly I felt a bit disappointed when it was all said and done.
It's a story-driven game for sure, which means you're on rails for most of it. However, you do get quite a few opportunities to explore off the beaten path, albeit mostly pointless but it's appreciated. I thought the world building was pretty neat along with the story and the cool artstyle. However, I felt there was a MAJOR lack of bug diversity: I was expecting to see some slugs, mantis, or beetles, but it seems it's just the same 3 bug models with retextures or some props glued on. You'd think a game about bugs would have more than a couple bugs to gawk at, but I guess it wasn't up to me. 
All-in-all, it didn't feel like a rushed experience for once, despite the entire game not being paced very well. The levels weren't exactly connected very well either, but I think that's part of the surreal, Kafkaesque aesthetic. 
I don't know how to conclude this, so I'll just say this: It was a neat 5 or so hour game for what it was, I don't know if it's $25 worth of game though. Take that as you will.",345,english

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"A demo desse jogo estava disponível no último evento da Steam e desde que joguei fiquei MUITO ansiosa para jogar a versão completa.

A proposta dele, de ser baseado em uma obra de Kafka me chamou muito a atenção, ainda mais pelo fato de que você se torna o protagonista da história e passa pela transformação de se tornar um inseto e ter que lidar com as suas novas limitações.

Entretanto, se você espera que o jogo seja uma versão jogável do livro, tenho más notícias: ele tem sim várias referências, você se transforma num inseto, alguns elementos também estão presentes, mas ele não é A Metamorfose jogável.

Vamos aos pontos bons:

- Ele é muito divertido. Virar uma barata, andar pelas paredes, ver o mundo de ponta cabeça é muito engraçado. É o tipo de jogo que melhora seu ânimo enquanto você joga.  

- Ele é um jogo simples, sem desafios ou quebra-cabeça muito difíceis, caso você esteja procurando algo mais tranquilo de jogar.

- As conquistas são fáceis de se obter:  só jogando, sem correr atrás de conseguir as conquistas propositalmente, consegui umas 17 (são 22 no total se não me engano). 

Mas nem tudo são mil maravilhas não é mesmo? Os pontos ruins são:

- Ele é muito curto. Se você não morre ou não demora muito pra conseguir passar dos capítulos (são 8 no total), ele não chega a ter nem 5h de gameplay. Chutaria que, no máximo, umas 4h. O que pelo preço é algo meio frustrante. 

- Não sei se é consequência do tempo de gameplay, mas parece que faltam informações para a história. A maior parte do tempo você passa dialogando com outros insetos para saber o que fazer, mas não recebe explicação sobre praticamente mais nada pra te ajudar a entender o que está acontecendo. 

- O fato de ele ser em primeira pessoa pode te deixar enjoado, já que a movimentação da câmera as vezes é muito rápida, e numa parte em que você cheira uns pós de cogumelo e fica meio doidão e tela toda fica se mexendo como se você estivesse embaixo d'água.

Bom, o fim do jogo cabe a sua interpretação. Como ele não te dá informações sobre o porquê de você virar um inseto, o porquê da Torre existir, e o porquê de certas coisas acontecerem, o fim da história cabe a você interpretar e entender. 

Se você não sabe se compra ou não: espera uma promoçãozinha, apesar dos pontos ruins (que podem não ser ruins pra outra pessoa) o jogo é bem legal, e pode te divertir por um tempo, assim como eu me diverti com ele ^^.",581,brazilian

[quote]Puoi guardare la versione completa di questa recensione [url=https://youtu.be/hnmR9eH4Yu4][b]sul mio canale [i]YouTube[/i][/b][/url].[/quote]
[i]Metamorphosis[/i] è un gioco di avventura con elementi puzzle, immerso in un’ambientazione bizzarra e misteriosa, direttamente ispirato al racconto breve di [i]Franz Kafka[/i], [i]“La metamorfosi”[/i].

Proprio come nel racconto, il nostro protagonista è una persona qualunque, un commesso viaggiatore di nome [i]Gregor Samsa[/i], che un giorno, di punto in bianco e senza spiegazione, si risveglia tramutato in insetto.

Ma i riferimenti al racconto di [i]Kafka[/i] si fermano qui, perché se il protagonista del libro è un insetto a dimensione umane, esattamente come [i]Jeff Goldblum[/i] ne [i]La Mosca[/i], il [i]Gregor Samsa[/i] di [i]Metamorphosis[/i] è al contrario un essere umano ridotto alle dimensioni minuscole di un insetto, come accade al protagonista di [i]Bad Mojo[/i], un grande classico dei videogiochi del 1996.

Ovviamente le cose si fanno strane fin dall’inizio, quando appena messo piede giù dal letto notiamo di avere un'inconsueta andatura, incerta e sobbalzante, mentre dalle pareti del corridoio ci osservano insetti in giacca e cravatta, che ancora più stranamente sembriamo riconoscere.

La verità ci attende poco più avanti, quando l’incedere dei nostri passi si trasforma nel picchiettio di 6 zampe chitinose e la nostra voce si distorce orribilmente, mentre il corridoio di casa si rivela essere la bocchetta di un condotto di aerazione di una casa molto più grande.

Una casa all’interno di una casa. Siamo veramente un umano nel corpo di un insetto, o siamo un insetto che pensa di essere umano? Mentre domande esistenziali guizzano tra le nostre sinapsi, raggiungiamo la scrivania, firmiamo la liberatoria e sprofondiamo all’interno del foglio, verso un nuovo appagante impiego come membro produttivo della [i]Tower[/i].

Ma cos’è la [i]Tower[/i] e perché nessuno legge mai i termini e le condizioni prima di accettare?

[i]Metamorphosis[/i] ci vede catapultati nel mondo alternativo degli insetti, una società organizzata nascosta all’ombra di quella degli umani, dentro un cassetto, nell’intercapedine tra i muri, sotto il pavimento, o magari all’interno di un grammofono.

Semplici forniture da ufficio possono sembrare ostacoli insormontabili, ma con un pò di pensiero laterale si trasformano in percorsi adatti alle nostre zampette, che se debitamente inzaccherate con sostanze appiccicose danno un nuovo senso alla parola parkour. L’intero gameplay di [i]Metamorphosis[/i] si basa su esplorazione e puzzle ambientali, organizzati in scenari che incoraggiano il giocatore ad osservare il problema da una diversa angolazione, per poi mettere a frutto le nostre peculiari abilità da insetto, riprodotte in maniera molto efficace.

Infatti, nonostante lo stile di [i]Metamorphosis[/i] sia lontano dal realismo, le guizzanti movenze del nostro insetto sono realizzate in maniera assolutamente credibile, al punto che il vivace ticchettio dei nostri arti potrebbe far rabbrividire, mentre il mondo di gioco è rappresentato in una scala convincente e dettagliata, abitato da grotteschi esseri umani apparentemente ignari della nostra presenza, immersi nelle vicende di una storia che si dipana parallela alla nostra.

La trama di [i]Metamorphosis[/i] è un susseguirsi di compiti mondani e tediosi che nelle nostre condizioni miniaturizzate diventano imprese di dimensioni titaniche, tant’è vero che per quasi tutta la durata della nostra avventura saremo all’inseguimento di un certificato che dovremo produrre, validare e consegnare, in una brillante allegoria che in modo kafkiano, pone noi e il protagonista contro l’inesorabile macchina della burocrazia, spinti da personaggi misteriosi dalla dubbia moralità, che sembrano insetti ma si comportano come politici, intellettuali e ruffiani.

[i]Metamorphosis[/i] è un'avventura molto breve, ma intelligente e ben curata, che tratta la monotonia della società in modo satirico e stimola la nostra materia grigia, mentre cerchiamo di svelare il mistero in cui siamo caduti e ci domandiamo se la nostra condizione dopotutto abbia un senso.

[b][i]Has it ever occurred to anyone that many of the walking simulator and side-tasks adventure games have roots in Kafka's novels by their structure?

You've got a main task. You're looking for help to complete it and come across the right people.

And you either have to do something or find what they need.

After you've got it and given away the items or the necessary information, you've got to move to the next character. And it needs something else.

In some games it takes a long, it depends.

Of course, it looks mostly not so dystopian, burocratical and hopeless as in Kafka's masterpieces.

For example, in Eastshade it‘s a real fun.

You'll have to solve puzzles, by interacting with the environment, to make progress in the game. This is done in a very clever way and the puzzles are just hard enough to keep the player interested. Since you're a tiny bug, the world around you has become enourmous. Mundane objects are now hurdles to overcome and you'll have to make clever use of those objects. 

Another thing I enjoyed very much was the atmosphere and feel of the game. The graphics were lovely, almost like a painting coming to life, and the sound design was absolutely top notch.

Of course, a writer like Kafka created his own visionary universe so the developers had excellent source material to work with. The environments/maps and the dialogue(subtitled on account of the delightfully bizarre sounding insect voices) in this game are outstanding. The controls are tight and the innovative soundtrack fits perfectly. There are subtle nods to games like Naissance as well as classics like Portal, HL2 and Dishonored. The developers nailed everything in this game. The ending was a bit abrupt and things end on a very serious fairly depressing note but hey, it's Kafka we're talking about here. Actually, there was a lot of good humor scattered throughout the game so overall it's not really that depressing. It's a great little first person adventure game and well worth your time.

  En la industria hemos asumido roles poco comunes, criaturas alienígenas, animales salvajes u ominosos entes supernaturales, de modo que interpretar a un escarabajo no debería suponer nada descabellado, sin embargo, Ovid Works logra romper el molde, puesto que realmente hace sentir aquella disparatada transformación. Es decir, vivir los cambios en tiempo real y su efecto en el ambiente, una serie de detalles que permiten afinar la literatura de lo absurdo. Tal vez, no sea absolutamente fiel a la obra de Franz Kafka, puesto que los chicos de Ovid Works se han tomado ciertas libertades creativas con el fin de re-inventar esta icónica obra y sorprender al público. El resultado final, no deja de ser curioso, pero con un embriagante aroma de misticismo, que tan bien le sientan a los gigantescos mundos de papel ideados por el autor.

  En lo que respecta a jugabildiad, Metamorphosis hace uso del plataformeo y la lógica a través de puzles ambientales para meternos en los inusuales recovecos de la habitación de Gregory. Al controlar un insecto los movimientos tienden a ser ligeramente diferentes a lo que estamos acostumbrados, puesto que ahora el tamaño se ha reducido de manera considerable. Además, le han crecido un par de extremidades extra con una fuerza sobrenatural para saltar grandes alturas o adherirse como una estampilla en las superficies, aunque para esto último necesitaremos de algún que otro aderezo. 

 Metamorphosis no es el primer intento por llevar los oníricos mundos de papel de Franz Kafka a la industria de los videojuegos, puesto que ya existe algún que otro precedente. Precedentes regulares o más bien medidores, pero existen, para bien o para mal. Por lo tanto, no es terreno desconocido, sin embargo, esta nueva aproximación, es la más correcta con una armonía sobrenatural en cada uno de sus apartados. En fin, Ovid Works  inicia su carrera en la industria de los videojuegos con el pie derecho, con una correcta y contemplativa aventura interactiva. Quizás un juego algo corto, pero intenso, que interpreta muy bien el relato de Kafka.

[h1] Puntos Positivos[/h1] 

   *Una aproximación bastante acertada de la obra de Kafka.
   *La sensación de controlar a un insecto está bien conseguida.
   *Una experiencia surrealista sin igual.
   *Escalar sus escenarios tiene su encanto.
   *Una dirección artística muy bien cuidada.

 [h1] Puntos Negativos [/h1] 

   *Quizás los puzles podrían evolucionar en paralelo con sus escenarios y generar desafíos más exigentes.
   *Duración algo ajustada.
   *Inexistente soporte para resoluciones ultra-panorámicas.

At the start of the game you find yourself turned into a tiny little bug and at first it is very Alice in Wonderland like as your character is discovering what it means to be transformed into a bug.

You can crawl on surfaces and run and jump to other platforms. Also if you touch something sticky like paint or ink you get a kind of a stamina meter that allows you to walk up surfaces and on the side of walls.

And so overall this is a decent puzzle, platformer but what makes this game truly special is the world and environments you are exploring. Every area of the game is super beautiful or super interesting to explore and you can tell a lot of effort when into the presentation of the game.

Also the story revolves around you trying to make your way at first to a mystical tower which will supposedly get you closer to finding a way to become a human again and because of this, there are whole little civilizations of other bugs that you can talk with and gain some lore into this smaller bug world. 

I was not expecting the game to have a ton of dialogue and lore but it does, and some of the dialogue is genuinely emotional and sometimes freaking hilarious. The writing in this game is top notch.

I also really like how your story parallels with another story going on in the human world at the same time.

Overall if this game seems intriguing I would highly recommend you to stop reading reviews about this game and just go play it for yourself as I think a lot of the fun in this game is discovering and learning about this super fascinating world.

I've played some strange games, but none took me on a journey quite like this. Soundtrack was excellent, art style was a surreal gallery of paintings come to life.

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"SINTESI DEL GAMEPLAY

In sostanza il gioco è incentrato sull'esplorazione e il platforming 3D. In pratica la difficoltà sta nel raggiungere gli obiettivi (saltando e scalando) e nel risolvere puzzle estremamente semplici.

ESTRO ARTISTICO

Il gioco ha una direzione artistica superlativa. L'estetica e la narrazione sono curatissimi. M. è ovviamente ispirato al romanzo di Kafka ""La metamorfosi"" ma assume toni ancora più lisergici, più vicini alle opere di Carrol per capirci. La narrazione lascia intuire che tutto sia una grande metafora umana, come anche una grande satira sociale. Se la sfida degli sviluppatori era quella di farci provare la suggestione di essere piccoli come un insetto, il gioco ci riesce perfettamente, come riesce a trasmettere, spesso anche con una certa ironia, il dramma esistenziale del nostro personaggio.

PRO

Direzione artistica al top. Grande narrazione. Grandi suggestioni visive ed emotive.

CONTRO

Chi cerca più gameplay che narrazione, più gameplay che esperienzialità, e chi non sa che farsene del platforming 3D, troverà il gioco ripetitivo.",1806,italian

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"[i]Metamorphosis[/i] is a first-person-platforming adventure developed by the young polish studio Ovid Works.

The game is partially based on Franz Kafka's story of the same name, [i]Metamorphosis[/i], in which Gregor Samsa wakes up as a bug one morning after anxious dreams, however while Gregor, the player character, does indeed transform into a bug, much of the story is actually based on another story by Kafka called [i]The Trial[/i]. This was to be expected as the storyline of [i]Metamorphosis[/i] would hardly make for a good game, and [i]The Trial[/i] is a good choice for a conflict and as Kafka's second most popular story.

Essentially, you are turned into a bug and overhear your friend Josef K. get arrested before you could draw anyone's attention to you to help you. You are now on your quest to become human again and to help your friend Josef with his trial. This duality of the story becomes interesting and important later on, however since the game is so short I don't want to give anything away.

The game itself is a first-person-platformer, and I know what that sounds like. It sounds shit. But to my surprise, it largely isn't. The movement feels fun, the game is very lenient with letting you get away with jumps and even when you fail the time it takes to respawn is surprisingly short, almost instant even. The game also manages to make crawling around quite intuitive, even if some structures of clutter seem a bit ouf of place. The only problems with it are that some walls you can't climb aren't indicated properly and sometimes when crawling the camera gets a bit confusing, but that's no big deal. Levels vary, look gorgeous and don't overstay their welcome. If you ever get lost, pressing Tab gives you an overview of the level and marks points of interest. The atmosphere is great, a lot of the books and documents are (accurately to Kafka) in german as the game takes place in Vienna and the smooth orchestral soundtrack is outstanding for this type of game and also features german vocals whenever it uses vocals. The artsy 1920s style just scratches an itch for me, I guess.

The game has some shortcomings though. For one, it is literally short. 20,99€ for a 4-hour-game is a hefty price, at least for me, but then again I also didn't mind that with other games from the narrative first-person adventure genre like [i]Gone Home[/i] or [i]Firewatch[/i]. Just be wary wether or not  that's the type of game you want to pay this much for.

But there's also shortcomings in the technical department:  Voice clips that play twice in a row when they shouldn't, at times janky platforming, spelling mistakes in the german translations and kind of uncanny animations and models for humans (though that may just be to make them more grotesque). And for me at least, the game also had issues with performance, though I will have to check this once I have a more up to date PC.

You could also argue that the story only really resembles Kafka's writing on the surface level, since it's hard to express and at the same time gamify the frustration of bureacracy and hardships of life that Kafka dealt with (except that this has been done before successfully with [i]Papers, Please[/i]).

But at the end of the day, while it wasn't as grandiose, deep and artistic as I wanted it to be, it was a fun evening and a bold and interesting idea for a game, and I'll be looking out for what comes next from Ovid Works.

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"I am an hour in the game and I guess that's enough for a first little ""review"".

This game is a first person adventure/puzzle game like among the sleep and others.
You play a little bug that tries to reach ""the tower"".
I will not say more about the story because of spoilers.

The game runs smooth without any bugs. The grafic is good (not mindblowing but fitting) and the controls with a gamepad are intuitive. The Voiceover is good.
The puzzles are not that hard and it's more like a ""where should I go next"".
The game has a lot of Kafka references (not only gregor samsas metamorphosis) but it's not the story told as a game... 
Overall this game is a cool adventure and the walking around like a bug is a fresh thing.

Die Umgebungen sind schön und abwechslungsreich gestaltet, was gegen Ende etwas abnimmt, was aber auch zur Erzählung passt. Literatur-Kenner entdecken Anspielungen auf Die Verwandlung, das Urteil oder der Prozess, die mit viel Respekt in die Geschichte eingebunden sind.

Key cedida pelos Desenvolvedores

Metamorphosis, um jogo indie desenvolvido pela Ovid Works e lançado pela All in! games, conta a história de uma pequena e misteriosa aventura de Gregor Samsa, que foi transformado em inseto para tentar recuperar seu corpo e ajudar seu melhor amigo Joseph, que foi acusado de cometer um crime.

O jogo apresenta um mundo misterioso e corrupto de uma perspectiva completamente diferente de qualquer outro jogo de detetive. 

Gregor acorda de uma ressaca e se vê trancado em um quarto relativamente familiar, mas logo ao notar que está “preso” em um corpo de inseto, a forma como o jogo é conduzido é completamente alterada. Metamorphosis tem uma jogabilidade fluída e simples. Não há nenhum tipo de confronto. O design de níveis e os quebra-cabeças são os únicos obstáculos para o progresso do jogo. Esses problemas podem ser facilmente resolvidos com um pouco de paciência e atenção.

O mundo de Metamorphosis é basicamente dividido em mundo humano e mundo dos insetos. 

O primeiro mundo, o dos humanos, tem um level design fantástico: cada livro, obstáculos quase intransponíveis, pequenos objetos, e muitas outras coisas tem seu papel no jogo. A disposição de cada objeto é como em uma casa de qualquer família, o que torna a busca por um caminho não tão óbvia no início. 

Já o segundo mundo, o dos insetos, se torna uma experiência ainda mais incrível com direito a passagens escuras e nojentas, cidades inteiras de insetos, e algumas partes que chegam a ser quase alucinógenas!

Em termos de jogabilidade, o jogo segurará sua mão conforme necessário e dirá onde você deve ir através de um sistema de mapas muito interessante; um equilíbrio entre muitas informações mas sem ser um ""detonado"" estragando as melhores partes do jogo. Os controles são rápidos, precisos e responsivos (embora eu tive que desativar a função de suavização da câmera, que resulta em um pequeno delay do mouse). Exceto pela confusão mental durante a navegação, e ao andar pelas paredes do jogo (onde se perde a noção de cima ou baixo), no geral não encontrei problemas com o jogo. As travessias por todo o ambiente são tão deliciosas que você chega a sentir falta de um sistema de combate para dar vontade de ficar mais tempo nessas áreas. A pior parte do jogo é fetchquest: você fala com um personagem, e o personagem pede que você resolva um problema que outro personagem possa resolver, mas ele pede que você obtenha outras coisas de outro personagem, e assim por diante. Apesar de toda essa burocracia, embora seja algo chato, ainda se encaixa na temática do jogo.

O jogo é influenciado por Franz Kafka, principalmente no conto “A Metamorfose”, onde o protagonista de mesmo nome também se transformou num inseto, alegando que o personagem é inútil, insignificante e desprezível para sua família. Por outro lado, esse jogo é claramente uma alegoria da burocracia em nosso mundo, e até parece ser feito por brasileiros, pois costumamos tratar as pessoas pertencentes ao sistema como insetos sujos. Mesmo assim, a grande maioria das pessoas ainda sonha em manter a estabilidade por meio de competições (como concursos por exemplo), e o jogo reflete bem esse auge da corrupção e da burocracia, que nos faz sentir insignificantes, principalmente para pessoas como Joseph que estão presas nas “algemas” da burocracia sem entender o verdadeiro significado do que está de fato acontecendo.

TLDR: Metamophosis é uma aventura pequena e inspiradora com um mundo lindo para explorar, mas sem muitos objetivos. Sem lutas ou confrontos, o mundo acabará por passar rapidamente, pois explorar é o único objetivo na maioria das áreas. Mas o jogo conhece seu propósito e para que veio, é acima de tudo uma aventura narrativa com quebra-cabeças e uma plataforma competente, e seu tamanho não excede o que deve. Eu concluí o jogo zerando em aproximadamente 4 horas, mas foram 4 horas bem proveitosas. De acordo com as conquistas do Steam, completei apenas 69%, então, em minha opinião, ainda há muito o que fazer. Eu definitivamente irei explorar este mundo novamente.",232,brazilian

I think a lot of people will find this game enjoyable, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and for a cheap price.

Metamorphosis Nails Both Its Kafka Inspiration and Its Sense of Scale Perfectly. Very Enjoyable Platforming Adventure.

Intro
Hello everybody, I’ve returned with a brand-new review! In this one I’m covering an indie platfoming adventure game based on a famous book by Franz Kafka called Metamorphosis by Ovid Works and All In! Games.

To be completely honest, I’ve yet to actually read the original book by Franz Kafka but I’ve heard of it quite a few times over the years. I also know very little about Franz Kafka himself other than that he wrote some pretty wild stories, Metamorphosis being one of them. After playing this game, I’ve definitely become pretty fascinated by the book and I definitely plan to give it a read in the near future. The game’s story definitely feels like it was created while high on acid or on an LSD Trip, it’s quite weird which is the very definition of many of Kafka’s stories from what I’ve heard. It definitely captures that sense of weirdness quite well.

I also found it rather amusing that the developers are called Ovid Works because the ancient writer/philosopher Ovid also wrote a book called Metamorphosis. Fitting name on two accounts.

As for the game, it’s wild but it’s an intriguing kind of wild. I’ve always been drawn to surrealist and overly weird games and stories, so I was immediately drawn into the experience. I wound up playing it in just about one go as well. It was all very immersive and I believe it largely had to do with its amazing sense of scale. You really feel like you’re nothing but a mere bug in the world because everything is so enormous compared to where the camera sits. I’ll also admit there were definitely times when it gave me pretty hardcore vertigo, especially when jumping from high up, whew, was pretty nuts for sure.

I think that about covers our introductions for this review so let’s shrink ourselves down and head to the tower to get this review started!

Story and Setting
The story to Metamorphosis revolves around a man named Gregor Samsa who is suddenly turned into a bug by something known as The Tower. He must traverse his friend Josef’s house as a bug in order to reach The Tower itself and hopefully transform himself back into a human again.

The journey takes you across some pretty crazy landscapes, each filled with friendly bugs who will often aid you in your quest. Some even have their own stories for you to discover as well. Some areas include Josef’s bedroom, a bar inside a gramophone, and a bug city created around an old and decaying projector. The journey is a decent length and you meet a wide variety of unique characters along the way.

One thing I found really cool about this game was the fact that it has its own language for the bugs that’s vaguely English but wholly bug sounding. If you listen carefully enough you can make out some words being said as well. I thought this was a very cool touch and definitely made the bugs more unique in the process.

The story was a pretty fascinating one to say the least, especially in the end when the big surprise is revealed. Made me kinda glad that I haven’t read the book yet because it would have likely spoiled the ending to this game. That said I probably spoiled the ending to the book now so, double-edged sword.

Gameplay
Much of your time in Metamorphosis will be spent making your way through various levels as you attempt to reach the tower. The majority of the gameplay revolves around platforming your way across objects that are much larger than you in size. There are some objects that you’ll be able to grab onto by default but to climb up walls, you’ll need to make yourself sticky with glue or ink blots that are spread throughout some areas. The stickiness will run out with use though so you’ll have to watch the meter to make sure you’ll be able to make it to your destination.

Outside that, the game is your average platforming experience, except on a much smaller scale.

Graphics and Sound
The graphics in this game are quite impressive all around. I mentioned before that I liked the sense of scale in this game and I 100% meant it. It’s quite impressive that the developers managed to get the scale of objects so perfect that it really felt like you were a tiny, insignificant bug wandering around a world much larger than itself. Mad props for managing that because it made the game so much more fascinating.

The voice acting for the game was equally impressive. The unique language that was created for the bugs was a very cool touch and I don’t think the game would have had the same effect if the bugs simply spoke straight English like the human characters. It also greatly added to the overall weirdness of the game too because combined with the scale of the objects, the language your character speaks definitely helped in creating a very immersive experience.

The sound effects and music also fit the game very well. The music blended into the background seamlessly and it improved the sense of mystery and wonder at many of the things you were witnessing. There’s some very fantastical things going on in the bug world and the music definitely helped in shaping your first moments seeing each wonder.

Pros
Excellent, And Very Weird, Story
Excellent Sense of Scale
Unique Language Created For The Bugs Enhanced The Immersion Of The Game
Beautiful Graphics
Very Strange and Unique World To Explore
Excellent Music and Sound Effects
Great Voice Acting
Cons
The Ending Felt A Little Rushed
Final Verdict
Overall, Metamorphosis has easily become one of my favorite adventure games that I’ve experienced this year. It’s a highly enjoyable and very immersive experience and its superb sense of being tiny is just phenomenal. I loved everything about my experience with this game and I can’t recommend it enough. My only complaint is that the ending felt a little rushed but compared to the rest of the game this is a really minor issue, at least for me it is. The journey is great and that’s what matters the most.

In the end I’ve decided to give the game 4.5/5 Stars, a nearly perfect experience that I highly recommend giving a shot if you get the chance. https://endworldgaming.wordpress.com/2020/08/13/metamorphosis-review/",266,english

So if you are not ok with English, you can miss a part of experience (not much of a story, anyway). Also, it's funny to recognize the other names on the books and papers. The game is a gem, if you know what's it about. Perfect adaptation, masterpiece.

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game [/quote]

Metamorphosis is a game developed by Ovid Works and published by All in! Games and is a digital adaptation of Franz Kafka's book of the same name

Is this a good adaptation? Having read the book and now having finished this... it's not perfect but respects the source material

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same. The lip-syncing is awful and the voice acting performances (apart from the bugs) is abysmal to semi-bad

Metamorphosis overall, however, is an okay game to play which ends really quickly, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay-ish to meh adventure ""walking simulator"" game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

Summarized review below![/h1][/quote]
[h1]The rundown:[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Really cool level design
+ Fun platforming
+ Cryptic, yet interesting storyline
[b]Cons:[/b]
- Shallow puzzle design
- Disappointing ending

So I have a bit of a funny history behind why I decided to play this game. Back in 2014, I made a video on a game called Masters of the World – Geopolitical Simulator 3. One of the loading screen quotes for that game was a quote from Franz Kafka, whom I did not know at the time. Well, as you can expect, the comments made it very clear that I was stupid for not knowing who the man was.

So here we are nearly six and a half years later with a video game based on Kafka's most popular work: The Metamorphosis. Having since learned who the man was and having read that most popular work, I thought it'd be cool to give this game adaptation a look, even if it may be a loose adaptation.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[list][*][b]Really cool level design.[/b] Perhaps the most impressive thing about Metamorphosis is how it really sells the idea that you are an insect. Of course, this is largely due to the level design. The game has these massive environments full of all sorts of details, including the pencils laying around that form paths between platforms, the garbage that has been repurposed into little buildings, and the dangers brought on by objects we humans take for granted, like fans.

All of this really drives home the point that you are a small and vulnerable insect, nothing more, nothing less. It's exactly the same feeling I had while playing Grounded a few weeks ago. However, the devs couple this with a sort of surreal and gloomy visual direction, which makes for a very interesting combo. On one hand, you're a bug exploring this human-inhabited world, but on the other, there's something darker to it, something hidden away behind it all. It's definitely comparable to Kafka's original work in that regard, so I got to give the devs some credit there.

[*][b]Fun platforming.[/b] For what is effectively a walking sim, I was surprised with how much fun I had with the game's platforming. It's nothing too complex, but you've got your jump and your sticky feet ability that allow for a lot more exploration than what is usually the case with such walking sims. It removes a lot of the linearity to the game, allowing you to explore the environment and come up with your own routes as you play.

I had a lot of fun ignoring the ""expected"" route and just parkouring my own way up to wherever I needed to go, sometimes even breaking the game's platforming in a way by standing on ledges that are mere pixels in size. Granted, a lot of this is again due to the excellent level design, but it was such a standout feature to me that I felt it deserved its own spot.

[*][b]Cryptic, yet interesting storyline.[/b] So as I said earlier, this game is just a partial adaptation of Kafka's The Metamorphosis. It uses its main themes, but kinda goes off and does its own thing, borrowing from more Kafka stories in the process. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say that the game does a good job setting up this sort of dual narrative of sorts. You're figuring out the story related to the protagonist, while also developing this other story along the side, with the two becoming further linked as the game goes on.

It does a pretty good job at this, even if the actual storytelling may be cryptic. You'll get the occasional full-on dialogue cutscene, but most of the story is told through the environment and little snippets given by the different NPCs. It's like a puzzle of sorts and from the get-go it's obvious that there's more to it than what is just shown on the surface. It may falter a bit (which I'll discuss shortly), but I enjoyed it for the most part.[/list]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[list][*][b]Shallow puzzle design.[/b] The store page for the game describes it as having ""challenging environmental puzzles"", which is definitely a bit of a stretch. Not only are the puzzles not challenging, but it's kinda hard to even describe most of them as puzzles. You'll oftentimes be given a task that asks you to go to a certain location and interact with some object or other NPC and that's the extent of the so-called puzzle. Don't let the store page fool you, this is a walking sim with a decent amount of platforming and some very light puzzle mechanics, nothing complex enough to warrant the title of ""puzzle game"". And this is coming from a fan of walking sims, I just wanted to make sure nobody goes in with the wrong expectations here.

[*][b]Disappointing ending.[/b] I may have found the story interesting, but I definitely did not like how it ended up. The game had this interesting double narrative thing going for it before it just kinda, ended. I don't know if it was lack of funds preventing the full story from being realized, but it just wraps itself up so quickly that it's hardly satisfying. And I say this for both endings, as the game has two of them. I mean, the game only took me two hours to clear, so maybe it's just a side effect of being on the shorter side, but I feel like they could have done a better job leading up to the end and wrapping it all up.[/list]

[h2]Overall:[/h2]
Metamorphosis may be a short game, but it's still one I would recommend. From the wonderfully done level design to the fun platforming and cryptic storyline, there's some good stuff here. Granted, that story kinda crashes and burns by the end and the puzzle design isn't all that great, but I still had a good time with it. It might not be an immediate purchase, but worth a look if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle.

Basado en la metamorfosis de Kafka, encontraremos en Metamorphosis un juego a medio camino entre el walking simulator y unas plataformas sencillas pero entretenidas. 
Jugablemente nos dedicaremos a movernos de un lado a otro sin mucha más interacción que ir hablando con los personajes o resolviendo pequeños puzzles, pero aunque simple, las mecánicas de movimiento estan muy bien hechas, para representar el movimiento de un insecto, y se sienten especialmente ágiles y cómodas. 

Lo que de verdad merece la pena es la ambientacion de este titulo, que aunque corto, nos permitira visitar varias localizaciones cada una de ellas con una grandisima cantidad de detalle y muy bien representadas. 
El doblaje (en inglés) y la musica estan especialmente bien elegidos, y en conjunto, a nivel visual y sonoro es una propuesta muy solida. 

La única pega podría ser su duración, que es de unas 3-4 horas y lo lento de su ritmo, que hace mucho énfasis en las conversaciones. No es un juego para todo el mundo, pero para los amantes de la obra literaria, de los walking simulator o cualquiera que quiera experimentar un juego diferente, es una opcion bastante recomendada, aunque recomiendo tal vez esperar una rebaja.

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"A short but delightfully surreal game loosely based on Franz Kafka's eponymous novel, The Metamorphosis.

A platformer/puzzle hybrid, you wake up one morning to find yourself transforming into a bug, and set out to turn yourself back into a human. You do this by platforming around real locations, such as a bedroom or lawyer's office, and fantastical locations, such as a bug speakeasy located inside a gramophone, or a village of bugs preparing to watch a movie.

Being able to speak to the bugs is very charming, and there are a variety of little sidequests that give you more opportunities to do so, which is welcome. As you go through the real-world levels you'll observe your friend going through increasingly troublesome Kafkaesque bureaucracy, and listening to these conversations is quite entertaining. The puzzle elements are very light and consist of platforming, going up certain walls, and operating switches, so don't expect to be stuck for very long if at all.

The game is very short as evidenced by my 100% completion time, so it may be a tad expensive for you at full price, but if you see this on sale or in a bundle I can highly recommend this surreal gem.",267,english
0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"Got me to buy the complete works of Kafka. This game is a wonderful dream trip, blending the surreal experience of what it's like to look through the eyes of a bug with the existential nightmare of being a tiny, insignificant cog in a convoluted, impractical machine meant to exploit and inevitably throw you away all while making life unnecessarily hard and distracting to keep you running that proverbial hamster wheel.

Also appreciate this game for having the best possible movement for a walking sim of this nature. Fast, agile, and free, so much so that it's actually fun to just run around as a bug. a far cry better than a lot of walking sims that think slow and limited is the right way to go.

My only criticism is that the game restricts wall walking to requiring you have some limited resource like honey or ink to cling to walls. There's just not enough of a puzzle or challenge element to the levels to demand this restriction. It would have been better if it was just a default ability, allowing for unlimited full freedom. Also, and this really is just for aesthetics, but it would have been niffy to be able to walk upright. A bunch of other bugs do it, so why can't we, just for the sake of it?",210,english

The answer is: meh, sure. It's a very, VERY basic platformer that finds its strength in a couple of well designed levels and fun side characters.
When I say ""Well designed levels"" I mean it almost exclusively from a visual point of view, since the gameplay itself is always pretty dull. You justs scuttle around on your little bug-legs, occasionally climbing on surfaces and hitting buttons. 
The theme of the plot is still enjoyable even if you have no clue about the literary background, as it revolves around maddeningly inefficient bureaucracy.
The insect you will interact with along the way are all cool, and I particularly enjoyed the way they (and you ) talk.

The level design was nice enough, if not amazing by any means, but I did find the often poor quality of the textures fairly disappointing, especially since you spend all of your time so close to the ground that it really would have warranted more attention to detail, even with the stylized art style. Finally, the performance of Unreal Engine games seems to be hit or miss from player to player, but for me it was so utterly atrocious as to be nearly unplayable no matter the settings, which unfortunately detracted a good amount of enjoyment as well. Overall it's not bad, but there wasn't enough there for me to be worthwhile.",200,english

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"Seeing the trailer and the original demo for metamorphosis, things felt pretty interesting and neat- but I certainly did not get the experience that I thought I would get. This game is VERY different in story than what the trailer presents.

The game is enjoyable, and the story is decent. It's nothing incredible and at some point it feels like its rushing you, but for most of the game you'll probably be chatting to random bugs to see their flavortext, and maybe you'd be wandering around to see how the environment is built. The entire situation is in fact, quite absurd, and the game does not try to make it seem normal either. Everything in the game, the story, the situation, and the things that happen is straight up absurd and it revels in that.
My main gripes with the game are pretty basic, honestly. I went into the game to hear a story about a dude that turned into a bug and i got just that.

[h1]Here's most of the cons, possible SLIGHT spoiler warning?[/h1]
Note that these cons are mostly little nitpicks that bothered me rather than actual issues with the game.

[b]-The game really tries with its german in the OST[/b], due to being based off of kafka's work. The issue is is that if you're streaming this to show the game to your german friends, they will immediately notice that this is someone pretending to be german. Not a huge problem, but can be an annoyance.
[b]-Continuing on the german usage-[/b] A lot of texts on papers in the game are fully in german. This is great for flavor, but as someone that was trying to solve a puzzle by READING each readable object, I very much struggled because I couldn't understand anything!
[b]-Audio loops. God. So many of them.[/b] The audio loop between [spoiler]Joseph and the Lawyer[/spoiler] is infiuriating! There's at most 2-3 minutes of dialogue, that then proceeds to loop over and over again as you're going through the level.... Which lasts at least 20-30 minutes depending on if you know where you're supposed to go.
[b]But that's not all of it![/b] At some point, the NPC bug noises just... are the same set of sounds over and over again. This wouldn't be an issue for bugs there just to fill the space, or unimportant to the plot, but I could not enjoy actual serious scenes with characters that had some sort of importance to the plot because they were all using the same grumble, the same pitches, over and over again. It's incredibly sad, as I LOVE the whole ""bug language"" thing, especially Gregor's lines! They're all so unique and interesting!
[b]-Jumping is a bit scuffed.[/b] If you're not sprinting, and you're trying to jump while moving, it feels like there is not enough lunge to it. This is particularly annoying in platforming areas.
[b]-The end of the story is very sudden and lacklustre[/b]. I don't know if this is just normal in the original book this was based on, but I felt like the end of the game was very rushed and straight up like a deus ex machina. (and also unclear on how to get the ""good"" ending...). I wish that there would have been a bit more to the ""good"" ending, and not just [spoiler]Leni going ""lol tough shit ur a bug forever now""[/spoiler]. It could have been at least a little more extended.",251,english
0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"I recommend this game but only if you know what it has to offer beforehand.
You shouldn't play Metamorphosis if you're looking for:

- A direct adaptation of Kafka's book.
- A deep story filled with memorable characters.
- A challenging and lengthy game with complex gameplay.

You absolutely SHOULD play this game if you want:

- One of the most immersive and unique walking simulators i've ever played.
- A wonderfully bizarre, impressive looking world to explore.

Basically, if you don't mind shallow gameplay and a somewhat short runtime, you'll love Metamorphosis.",269,english

I wanted to wait for a few reviews before buying this, I had been watching it for a while and was hoping it would live up to expectations, although painfully short, I can highly recommend it. It is a wonderful experience, a beautiful world to explore and navigate, nothing too taxing just a deeply pleasant journey into bugs and bureaucracy. If you don't know Kafka's amazing works, The Metamorphosis and this incredible adaptation are a bit like ""A bugs life"" meets ""Brazil"" (Wow that dates me).
Thank you developers - Wonderful!",272,english
0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"This game is like a puzzle platformer but drunk, in a most excellent way. It's a variation on Kafka's metamorphosis, you are Gregor Samsa, and you've turned into a bug, how are you going to your initial human state? The gameplay reminds me a bit of the Alien in AvP but with much better controls. The perspective of the world seen through the eye of an insect is excellent, so far great humour and very eerie atmosphere. The art and graphics are very nice, they remind me of older games (like Dark Corner of the Earth or the more recent A Story About my Uncle, but polished with up to date graphics, its all very pretty!), which intensifies the feeling of strangeness. After 1.3h of game i'm completely into it, i've found the valve behind James Joyce's Ulysses, i've stopped the flooding and I'm wondering where the pipes will lead me... (so far the 20 quid are worth it)

Update: It took me 5 hours to finish the game while taking some time to explore, it seems like a fair amount of time. It is a rather short game but it is very satisfying, it is not a great challenge but it is a fantastic experience and for that I strongly recommend it.  I still think the 20 quid are worth it. Congratulations to the team at Ovid works for the pleasant gameplay and the amazing dreamlike art and ambiance throughout this game.",374,english

0,steam_reviews/1025410_Metamorphosis.json,471,103,"My old English teacher recommended the short novel to me and I loved it, so naturally I was intrigued by this game. 

[UPDATE]
I finished the game. It ended a lot more sudden and surprisingly than I had expected and wanted. Overall though, I still had a good time with it. It was a fun distraction.
What I said below still stands, though I'd like to add a few things. 
The story felt a bit rushed, especially towards the end. 
Aside from some subtle hints and themes, and the use of names, I also feel like this had almost nothing to do with the novella. (UPDATE: After reading some reviews, it seems that the story pays homage to some of Kafka's other works as well, which went over my head and is very interesting.)
The game definitely needs to be replayed in order to acquire all the achievements, which I like.
I just wish it offered more in almost every aspect, I really want to experience more. The unique characters are really interesting, but there aren't many. The world you've built is incredibly cool and creative, and i want to explore more. I almost feel like there is an opportunity for a single-player/coop RPG with what you've built. I also wish the game offered more of a challenge, as most if not all of the puzzles were only slowed down by me trying to find the way.
Albeit harsh, some negative reviews I feel are definitely warranted, but I can't say I personally wouldn't recommend this to someone who is in need of a quick little distraction. It was fun for what it was, and It didn't put a dent in my wallet.
Thanks for making this game and I hope to see more projects from you in the future!
[/UPDATE]

It's really fun, I feel I'm about halfway through, but I can say the movement mechanics are really enjoyable and the environments are beautiful. 
Puzzles are a little too easy, yet somewhat unclear at times but it feels like any direction you take will offer up clues. 
The bug characters are funny and interesting and have kept my interest up so far. 
The story is mysterious and unique but to get some points feels like a little bit of a chore and I wish it was written better or more interestingly.
Can't wait to finish this game, but so far I'd say it has a fair price and is pretty fun.",245,english
0,steam_reviews/1030840_MafiaDefinitiveEdition.json,56830,1,"[h1][b]Où est l' A D N de Mafia ?[/b][/h1] 
Le jeu était attendu comme le messie à sa sortie en 2002 et était l’un des très rares à venir attaquer GTA (GTA 3 / Vice City à cette époque) de manière agressive sur son terrain. C’était le studio tchèque “Illusion Softworks” qui créait Mafia (depuis renommé “2K Czech”). 
Vous dire comme je l'attendais ce jeu... :) . Internet et la communication autour du jeu vidéo étaient très loin de ce qu’on connaît aujourd’hui. Et je lisais le magazine “Joystick” à ce moment-là (« Canard PC » aujourd’hui), c’était ma principale source d’infos. Chaque fois qu’ils avaient des nouvelles encourageantes concernant la sortie du jeu, j’allais faire des coups de sonde à la FNAC du coin en espérant finalement le voir en rayon xD. 

[h1]Si vous ne connaissez pas l’original[/h1]
Mafia est une histoire classique de gangster aux États-Unis juste après la grande dépression de 1929. Elle se déroule dans la ville fictive de Lost Heaven, de taille modeste (malgré son aéroport) elle dispose d'un tramway, d’un métro aérien et de tous ces éléments qui font une métropole dense. 

 Illusion Softworks misait sur l’immersion, les détails, le réalisme et une certaine précision historique. Là-dessus, ils revisitent les canons et les codes des histoires de la mafia. Ici, elle est presque « banale » l'histoire. La fin des années 30, Tommy rencontre l'inspecteur Norman dans un “Diner”. Il a besoin de protection désormais et est disposé a lui confier les secrets qu'il connaît. Car il a travaillé pour « Don Salieri » le parrain d’un bout du “Little Italy” local et rival de « Morello » l’autre parrain en ville, dirigeant une organisation plus vaste et plus puissante que le premier. Les deux familles s’affrontent créant une série d’histoires suivies, mais s’étalant sur plusieurs années, alors narrées à Norman. 

[quote][b][u]Bon à savoir.[/u][/b]
Ne vous attendez pas à monde ouvert « d’aujourd’hui », bien qu’il y ait “[i]remake[/i]” (et pas seulement “[i]remaster[/i]”) il n’y a pas de changement profond du gameplay. Vous aurez très peu de raisons de vous balader en ville par vous-même, il n’y a pas de quêtes annexes, pas d’activités en jeu au-delà du récit initial (qui fait vraiment voyager), mais vous êtes néanmoins libre d’aller y faire ce que bon vous semble, à tout moment — à priori si vous le faite c’est pour contempler la ville, voler une voiture spéciale dans les beaux quartiers pour l'ajouter à votre collection ou bien vous essayer à la conduite de certains véhicules (pas d'argent ou de magasin non plus).[/quote]

En jeu, vous avez du tir à la 3e personne et de la conduite, efficace, voire “old school”. La narration est très présente, beaucoup de cut-scenes, discussions, etc. Dans les missions (une vingtaine), attendez-vous à faire les grands classiques : importez de l’alcool de contrebande (c’est la prohibition :P), racket, règlement de compte, cambriolage, etc.  L’histoire est quelque peu « adulte » et la majorité des personnages sont brutaux, vraiment pas des gens biens, il n’y a pas d'angélisme. Et mis à part quelques répliques un peu trop bateau sur la vengeance et l'honneur c’est une histoire plutôt correcte.
  Et c’est aussi valable qu’un jeu plus récent, pas de doute ici, je m’y amuse, je ne suis pas en mode « musée » à revisiter du déjà vu selon des normes vidéoludiques datées. Ça marche très bien. 

[h1]Mafia 2002, vous y avez joué[/h1]
C’est mon cas, et si vous avez senti une certaine réserve au-dessus, c’est normal. Je ne retrouve pas l’ADN de « mon » Mafia original, je l’aimais tant ce jeu. On en est assez loin, c’est une expérience nouvelle, identique mais différente à la fois et pas forcément avec de la nostalgie à la clé. 
[list][*][b][u]L’identité musicale[/u][/b]
Vous vous rappelez peut-être la somptueuse collection de morceaux d’époques (Miles Borthers, Django Reinhardt..) ils définissaient le jeu mais ils ne sont plus là. Envolés et remplacés par d’autres… qui me plaisent moins, qui sont moins bien sentis (les licences de ces morceaux étaient d'ailleurs la raison pour laquelle l’original fut supprimé puis remis à la vente sur certaines boutiques en lignes).   Notez aussi que la bande originale a changé et à l'exception du thème principal, c'est du neuf par Jesse Harlin (plutôt que Vladimir Šimůnek sur l'original).

[*][b][u]Casting[/u][/b] 
Il est entièrement refait et forcément en un sens... Vous savez ce que c’est, en 2002 les têtes sont composées d’une petite volée de polygones anguleux et figés avec une texture par dessus. Mais ça, la mémoire s’en fiche bien et retient une information « complète ». Du coup, la famille est loin de ce que je me représentais alors, leur voix aussi sont très différentes. Je m’attache moins facilement à eux. Je regrette de ne pas retrouver ceux que je « connaissais ». 

[*][b][u]Conduite[/u][/b]
C’était le reproche principal fait à la version de 2002. Une conduite orientée « simulation », exigeante. Et vous vous en doutez la conduite réaliste d’un véhicule des années 30, c’est…expérimental voir kafkaïen (mais avec un certain charme). Idem pour la police qui réagissait au moindre feu rouge brulé.  Dans ce remake, Hangar 13 a fait un choix logique et a basculé tout ça sur la difficulté (facile, moyen, difficile ou « classique » et la conduite peut se régler indépendamment sur normal ou bien simulation). À vous de voir ce que vous préférez. Je suis en « classique / simulation » et j’adore, chaque voiture à une sorte de « personnalité », demande des efforts… ça me plait. Il me plaît aussi d’activer le limitateur de vitesse pour éviter d’attirer l’attention des forces de l’ordre. 
[b][u]nb : [/u][/b]la course automobile à remporter au début du jeu conserve un challenge certain, il m’a encore fallu pas mal d’essais :D

[*][b][u]Histoire[/u][/b]
Ce n’est rien de significatif à mon sens, mais à de (très) nombreuses reprises, Hangar 13 a fait des ajouts. Des bouts d’histoires en plus, des anecdotes, des cartes et bâtiments un peu différents (le motel en dehors de la ville par exemple, le personnage de Biff a également droit à son propre bâtiment maintenant, etc.). Je ne sais pas si j'adhère ou non mais cela semble rendre la narration et la mise en scène plus fluide.[/list]
[h1]En général[/h1]
En termes de problème de jeu, pas grand chose à signaler pour moi, le pire que j’ai eu sont des discussions qui ne colle pas avec l’action en train de survenir, qui commentent l’action précédente, etc. 

Je note également des éléments très inégaux face au [i]remake[/i] comme si par endroit des zones avaient bénéficié de moins de soin et semblent plus 2002 que 2020. La distance de vue par exemple, à distance raisonnable, certains gratte-ciels sont flous et disgracieux. Il y aussi des zones légèrement plus « vides » que d'autres.
Mais visuellement c’est très propre, soigné, voir à couper le souffle sur certaines scènes, pas parfait, pas à la pointe mais à la hauteur du premier opus et c'est déjà beaucoup.

On peut finalement sentir qu'il y a eu beaucoup de travail (voir beaucoup d'amour) réinjecté par l'équipe dans les voitures et dans l'animation des nouvelles cinématiques. Je n'aurais pas forcément concentré mes ressources là-dessus à leur place mais je suis plutôt impressionné à ce niveau !

[b][u]Hangar 13 a fait du très bon travail avec cette “Defintive Edition”... seulement peut-être pas aussi bon qu'Illusion Softworks en son temps.[/u][/b][list][i]cf. Mafia 2, LA Noire[/i][/list]",864,french
0,steam_reviews/1034700_GRAY.json,462,1,"Easily the strangest game I have played so far. Kafka meets Bukowski meets comatose hallucinations and nightmares. Settings are bizarre and partly even disturbing to say the least. Sexual scenes are of the heavy kind, so definitely and absolutely nothing for youngsters. At the same time, this game is an enquiry into morals and it can make you think a lot about ethic questions. Thus, I judge this game as recommendable. - But exclusively for a decidedly mature audience!",93,english
0,steam_reviews/1039940_HashihimeoftheOldBookTown.json,276,2,"[h1]Loneliness was like water...That’s why I hated the rain[/h1]
This is a unique, psychedelic, bizarre BL visual novel and one helluva experience. It’s also a poignant story about friendship and loneliness. I wanted to describe it as Kafka meets Steins;Gate because the atmosphere struck me as kafkian, but probably a better reference points are Japanese authors of the early 20th century, especially Kyusaku Yumeno and his work Dogra Magra, extensively referenced throughout the vn. 

The uniqueness of the vn can be seen right away from [b]the setting[/b] to the visual presentation. It takes place in Tokyo in 1922, before the Great Kanto earthquake. It features a lot of cultural and literary references from the time and a handy encyclopedia. Although it’s all very educational don’t mistake this for a historical novel. Those references are there to infuse the setting with the spirit of the times, but this story could have played out in any time. Tamamori failed to get into the Imperial University and now works in a used bookstore, writes his fantastical stories and has daily conversations with his imaginary characters. When one of his friends is found dead he finds himself in a three day time loop. And the bizarre nightmare begins.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2002952883
Another unique trait is a [b]visual presentation[/b] starting from the sprites. Characters look pretty realistic for students of the time period, but sprites aren’t typical, they’re more like cutouts. At first I thought this was an interesting esthetic choice or maybe a writer poking fun at her own characters’ depth, but then it started to feel like a way to play with realities, since the game liked to play with stories within stories. Oftentimes you won’t see the sprites. Narration and conversations are held against pretty austere and minimalistic backgrounds with washed up colours and a certain flat monotony. Backgrounds of the city soaked in rain with shadows of people only add to this surreal feeling that this never ending rainy season has put the world in a twilight zone and washed all the colours away. The cgs are the real star though. There are over 150 of them and they are a mix of this minimalistic monotone flatness and a psychedelic mindfuck of exploding colours and patterns all coming from Tamamori’s rich imagination.  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2002999113
Aside from the excellent music and voice acting I especially appreciated the use of silence and the omnipresent sound of the rain which was used to great poetic effect. This poetic feel permeates the whole [b]writing[/b]. It was a joy to read every sentence, be it Tamamori’s inner thoughts that reveal his insecurities and ugly sides or the witty banter between friends and self depreciating conversations with his illusions. The writing is full of these wonderful details. But there lies a flaw. 

Because of this poetic writing I feel like the vn lacks in dramatic elements. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of ‘drama’ here as Tamamori’s stuck in time loops trying desperately to save his friends. But the vn is more interested in after effects, emotional fallout and Tamamori’s inner condition than in events and causes. Because of this, motivations of other characters are often not sufficiently explored and remain vague and unconvincing and that’s terrible for a true dramatic impact. I often forgot the motivation for a certain event and that is the major driving force for Tamamori’s journey. That’s why the vn often feels melodramatic. It lacks something to ground it. Combined with the time loop induced repetition of the same conversations, thoughts and plot points, the result is that the pacing suffers. This monotone repetition does give it that surreal nightmarish vibe, but with better pacing and true dramatic elements the vn could’ve avoided to actually be monotone through a good portion of Minakami’s route. 

Thankfully, [b]the characters[/b] are very colourful. The best character is the protagonist himself. Tamamori is a slacker, a dreamer, a wannabe writer with a wild imagination, a pretty selfish guy who needs constant attention from his friends. Ultimately he’s a guy who dreams about pure, true friendship like they had in childhood. An interesting case of a protagonist so brutally honest with himself and delusional at the same time. He’s pretty self depreciating and is hilarious in a way he’s aware of his flaws and just brushes them off, or accepts them as a necessary part of his genius. Also, wears glasses to look smarter. Nyhaha...

Let’s not forget this is yaoi and his friends are potential love interests. To be honest, this game could’ve done without romance and it wouldn’t have changed the story and themes. Romance is another step and it’s thanks to the strength of the writing that this crossing doesn’t come off artificial and jarring. The first chapter, [i]Minakami[/i]’s route, is the longest and the most tragic and romantic. Minakami’s a kind childhood friend with an almost zen calmness and extreme love for reading. He lives for Tamamori’s stories. It’s pretty apparent that he loves him. Romance is the most natural in this route, especially from Tamamori’s side. This chapter doesn’t have any choices and is effectively the whole story. Other routes are like bus stops disembarking from it and exploring other possibilities and relationships, but not adding much to the overall story.

[i]Kawase[/i] is the second route, another childhood friend, a sadistic clean freak (or fake germaphobe and just a misanthrope as Tamamori calls him). He likes to torment Tamamori and is a harsh critic/destroyer of his writing/delusions. He’s ridiculously blunt and their back and forth is the highlight of the game. He’s jealous of Minakami and is also secretly in love with Tamamori. You can see the pattern. His route nicely complements Minakami’s. It has the mystery vibe. [i]Hanazawa[/i], the third friend, is a stoic military guy, a ‘big brother’ whom they haven’t seen in 8 years. It becomes obvious that he’s quite intense and extreme about everything: his asceticism, his bravery, patriotism, his one-track mind. His route is very short, but intense and has a rather bizarre adventure theme. [i]Professor[/i] is not a childhood friend, but a weird eccentric genius and Tamamori’s biggest fan much to his confusion. He’s the submissive one with masochistic tendencies always provoking Tamamori’s sadistic side. Despite his weirdness, he’s a genuinely good person, a loveable weirdo. His route started very melodramatic but turned into hard sci-fi. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2118222576
What about [b]sex scenes[/b]? Tamamori’s always the uke. Two characters offer role reversal but he refuses. Similar to romance, sex scenes aren’t necessary. They conclude every chapter as is traditional in many VNs. But unlike many eroge, sex scenes here don’t feel artificial. That’s because character work isn’t abandoned suddenly and characters don’t turn into porn actors. They retain their characterisation throughout and those scenes become another way of exploring them and their relationship. So you can skip them but you will miss character moments. The only exception is the last chapter.

The last chapter is very controversial. It features Man in Noh mask, a mysterious giant always stalking Tamamori and apparently living in his basement, just like in his story. I had a hunch about the type of ending this vn might get because there were lots of hints, especially those literary references. Unexpectedly I loved it. It helped me see a lot of shortcomings in a new light. In the end the whole story is the Ouroboros. It finished how it started...[i]Until it's dawn[/i]

0,steam_reviews/1039940_HashihimeoftheOldBookTown.json,276,2,"Hashihime of the old book town is a devastatingly beautiful love letter to lesser known cult classic literature, as well as the fleeting nature of the early 20th century with all its anxiety and turmoils. While Yumeno Kyuusaku's Dogra Magra was touted as the main inspiration, it was even more delightful for me to learn about other works referenced in the game, such as Yoshiya Nobuko's Flower Tales.

Neither a masterfully written novel nor a well executed dark romance, Hashihime is, instead, a  highly accomplished avant garde narrative, that brings to mind Terayama Shuji's movies, Suzuki Seijun's Taisho trilogy, animated series by Ikuhara Kunihiko, or the works of Franz Kafka. Most importantly, it is very much its own thing, as I know of nothing else that is both so highly surreal and well grounded, in fact, its roots are planted firmly in the ground, like a plant that grows nasty black orchids. Flowers of evil.

I love the finale (Kaoru's route) and was heartbroken to hear that its conclusive status was retconned due to upset fans. Regardless, this is Kurosawa Rinko's passion project and I respect her decision to give her readers a gentler resolve.

P.S. [spoiler]In my view, the beauty of the last route lies in the symbolism for moving on from the tragedies of one's youth with poise and grace; as well as the honouring of the very private romance between a reader and his favourite books: each of them boundlessly derived, woven into the most forbidden traumas as he coped with the turbulences of his life & his heart.

[quote=June] Sometime I just dream of you answering the phone.	[/quote]

Варто сказати, що крім проєктів з високою реіграбельністю, розрахованих на те, що гравець проведе в них не один десяток годин (на кшталт того ж Iratus: Lord of the Dead або Mortal Kombat 11, в яких я проводжу багато часу), я люблю ""одноразові"" ігри. Одноразові вони в тому плані, що створені, як правило, для проходження впродовж одного вечора і не передбачають безлічі повторних забігів по рівнях (у цьому плані бувають винятки), а часом навіть не мають системи збережень через знову-таки коротку тривалість.

Колись я вже писав огляд на одну гру, яка дуже схожа на сьогоднішній проект. Це була Marie's Room, яка викликала в мене позитивні почуття і показала, що навіть короткі інді-проекти здатні зацікавити спокушеного гравця і дозволити відпочити від великих проектів. Answer Knot на неї досить сильно схожа (тут навіть є відсилання на Marie's Room), хоч і пронизана дещо іншою атмосферою. 
Найімовірніше, цей огляд буде значно коротшим за інші (чи ні), все ж сама гра не дуже довга і її можна пройти в спокійному темпі за півгодини.

[h1] «Технічна частина» [/h1]

Знаєте, щоразу, коли я бачу заставку з логотипом Unity на початку гри, я готовий кинути монетку. І якщо у випадку з Іратусом, на якого я робив попередній огляд, все було чудово, то тут, мабуть, для балансу, все погано. 

Почнемо з того, що незважаючи на скромні системні вимоги, гра погано оптимізована і здатна видати 60 FPS тільки на мінімальних налаштуваннях (які ще й не в самій грі виставляються). Якщо ж ви гратимете з налаштуваннями Чака Норріса (так, так тут називаються максималки), то приготуйтеся до того, що гра видаватиме 30-35 кадрів на секунду.

Все було б ще нічого, якби в грі була шикарна графіка, але я б її такою не назвав. Деякі текстури справді непогано зроблені, але більша частина оточення не має вражаючого вигляду і на максималках, а якщо ж ви ввімкнете мінімальні налаштування, то все і зовсім буде виглядати, як ніби це гра з мобілок. 

Окремим пунктом хотілося б винести досягнення - їх легко отримати, і таким чином це була б ще одна ідеальна гра в профіль... якби Стім враховував досягнення з неї, чого він зараз, на жаль, не робить.


[quote=June] I don’t know what the fuck’s going on.	[/quote]

[h1] «Сюжет» [/h1]

Незважаючи на те, що гра доволі коротка, такий-сякий сюжет тут є, ба більше, він інтригує і мотивує грати далі (ну, кинути гру ви все одно не зможете - у такому разі доведеться проходити її заново). Головним героєм виступає Зак, одружений хлопець, який, крім усього іншого, любить подорожувати. Цього вівторка він залишається вдома один, тоді як його дружина вирушила на вечірку. По ходу сюжету вона повертається додому, відвідує магазин, аптеку, ну і таке інше, і частенько дзвонить чоловікові, в якого, до речі, звичка не брати слухавку стаціонарного телефону, тому ми просто слухатимемо монологи дружини і, за необхідності, переслуховуватимемо все на автовідповідачі. 

І якщо спочатку Джун (а так звуть дружину протагоніста) абсолютно спокійна і говорить про буденні речі, то з кожним наступним дзвінком її голос стає дедалі більш стривоженим, та й говорити вона починає про те, що навколо відбувається щось дивне, навіть просить Зака подивитися, чи на місці його пістолет. 

Більше нічого про сюжет не скажу, щоб не спойлерити, зазначу лише, що за якихось 10-15 хвилин грі вдається створити інтригу і нагнати саспенсу, а фінал історії дійсно несподіваний. Хоча під час гри я і знайшов кілька натяків на суть того, що відбувається, кінцівка все одно увігнала мене в ступор, і це при тому, що розказана історія тривала якихось півгодини.

[h1] «Геймплей» [/h1]

Геймплейно ж ми маємо класичний симулятор ходьби, обмежений межами однієї квартири. Після того, як Заку телефонує дружина, нам іноді потрібно виконати нескладні дії, пов'язані з тим, що сказала Джун, наприклад, подивитися, чи залишилося в холодильнику пиво, щоб вона знала, чи варто купувати ще. Предмети, з якими потрібно взаємодіяти за сюжетом, підсвічені словами, як це було в The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, що додає пару очок атмосфери грі. Більше ніяких складних завдань, за винятком однієї головоломки, яка вирішується за хвилину, у грі немає.

Автори прекрасно розуміли, що з таким набором механік гра сподобається далеко не всім, тому вирішили її урізноманітнити, причому зробили це доволі цікавим способом - додавши в неї купу пасхалок, якими гра заповнена трохи менше, ніж повністю.

Варто сказати, що ці пасхалки виконані досить непогано і явно здатні порадувати гравців. Для більшого залучення в процес пошуку на сторінці гри вказано загальну кількість пасхалок, а на форумі - кількість вже знайдених (які ще й поділені за категоріями, залежно від складності). Таким чином ви також зможете взяти участь у виявленні захованих секретів.

0,steam_reviews/1049410_Superliminal.json,22616,2,This was pure art. Like a playable David Lynch dream sequence with a little Kafka thrown in for good measure. Best $12 I’ve spent in a LONG time.,329,english
0,steam_reviews/1049410_Superliminal.json,22616,2,"Pretty mesmerizing, but not really a puzzle game.

I will preface this that I bought the game after seeing promotional demo clips years ago. The one of the objects changing in size and the objects that are painted on the wall that materialize if you stand in the right spot, what exciting concepts! I wondered what else they’d develop to enhance the dream like experience? The answer is: nothing. Not really.

You’re almost immediately presented with these concepts, which you use to solve simple puzzle games, usually enlarging an object to reach a door that’s higher up. Which is… fine.

After the initial stint of “training” in a “dream environment” things go awry and the game tries to give off eerie horror vibes. The story is that something has gone wrong in the dream facility and now the dreams are out of control. The game at this point is not really about puzzles anymore, but about navigating thru the room, finding your way in the dark.

Later on puzzle elements are reintroduced, and occasionally pretty original (I especially liked the warp doors that make you grow or shrink, which you use to escape a small box), but ultimately the puzzles are nothing more than speed bumps to navigate the WACKY DREAM world. Oh no! I fell! Oh no! I’m now walking on walls. That doesn’t happen normally!

I feel as if this game tries to be Portal a little bit , maybe combined with some Antichamber and a little bit of Stanley’s Parable sprinkled on top. I feel storywise the buildup isn’t as good as in Portal. In this game things pretty much immediately go wrong, and you don’t feel any sort of despair or worry. It is what it is. This due to lack of buildup. Antichamber is an amazing puzzle game, hard to navigate, following its own rules. Thing is, once you know the rules, you can navigate Antichamber fine. Superliminal has very limited interaction with objects (understandable, as they could be puzzle breaking), but sometimes you are reintroduced to interactable objects, and you can’t grab them anymore. They serve a decorative purpose. It’s pretty jarring. Also the fact that you can’t walk or grab thru open spaces  in enlargable objects is kind of jarring. I guess it has to do with how the models are made.

Generally, puzzle games, even abstract ones, give you a premise and rules on how to do problem solving. Oftentimes however, especially towards the end of the game, I found myself in a room with a bunch of stuff I couldn’t interact with, clicking around looking for the one interactable object or the wall that turns out to be fake. On occasion the sudden shift in scenery would be pretty impressive, and there were some original objects to be found. But it gets a little bit old rather quickly, especially when there’s no real puzzle left, just weird scenes.

Another thing that was a slight disappointment: the game doesn’t really reward you for exploring. In the beginning of the game I figured out I could climb up on a structure in stead of just going thru the door and found a (secret?) blue pawn, which disappeared. Satisfied, I assumed these would be scattered in the game, like secret objectives. However, later on, I tried to scale a wall using a giant chess piece, and as I finally managed to climb it a bit a grid appeared above my head. This is the developer saying “nope”. Again, this is fine, but it’s just one example of how I felt it a bit railroady and without much buildup. Sometimes there are very big spaces to explore, and if you manage to go “off grid” it’s more of a punishment than a reward because of the big empty space. The game seems to expect you to go from door to door at some point. Which is a bit in contrast from thinking outside the box. Also, it should be noted that it is quite a short game. I finished it in under five hours.

Superliminal reminded me a little bit of a game called The Beginner’s Guide. Which is just weird environment after weird environment, with more variation in scenery but less interaction than in this game. Unlike that game however, I did feel content about this game when it wrapped up.

Regardless of my critiques, I would still recommend this game if you mostly want a mesmerizing experience. I myself do like experiencing Kafkaesque vibes, this game is fun to submerge yourself in. Just don’t expect to do too much rational thinking. I do not regret my buy, especially given the launch price. 
Thanks devs!

update: I decided to change to ""not recommended"", because I think people will generally be disappointed if they expect a puzzler.",368,english
0,steam_reviews/10500_TotalWarEMPIREDefinitiveEdition.json,30241,1,"En fazla oynadığım Total War oyunu. Oyun fazla karmaşık değil, yönetim mekanizmaları çok rahat ve sade. Genellikle Osmanlı ve Büyük Britanya  İmparatorluklarıyla oynadım. Osmanlı Devleti'yle oynamak çok zevkli ve kampanyanın ilk 15 senesi oldukça sıkıntılı geçiyor. Fakat ilk 15 seneden sağ çıkmanız durumunda Osmanlı Devleti oldukça kuvvetli hale geliyor. Erken dönemde tek hat piyadeniz olan isarelilere çok iş düşüyor. Ayrıca filistin milisleri de hat piyadesi olarak doğuda iyi bir seçenek olarak göze çarpıyor. Arap milisleri ise doğuda ucuz hat piyadesi olarak tercih edilebilir. Osmanlı Devleti çok sağlam hafif piyadelere sahip. Balkanlarda Haydut ve Bosnian Panduklarının, doğuda ise Kürt ve Afgan dağlılarının çok etkili olduğunu rahatça söyleyebilirim. Azzar ise klasik hafif piyadeniz ve diğer saydığım hafif piyadelerden daha az etkili. Kafkaslarda ise Ermeni okçular, hafif piyade olarak erken dönemde faydalı olabilirler. Yakın dövüşte ise Cemaat Yeniçeri ve Başı Bozuklar var. Cemaat Yeniçeri savaş ve kuşatmalarda vazgeçilmez bir birim. Atlı olarak Deli atlıları çok üstün bir birim ve kampanya başında resmen light dragoon'a sahip oluyorsunuz. Kafkas ve Kırımda ise Tatarlar Delilerin ucuz bir alternatifi. Osmanlı topçuları ise erken dönemde organ gun gibi bir canavara sahip. Kampanyanın başında şarapnel teknolojisine sahip oluyorsunuz. Doğuda kılıçlı develileri atlılara karşı kullanabilirsiniz.  Osmanlı Donanması ise acilen geliştirilmeli. Fourth ve Fifth Rate Ship of Line'ye mümkün olduğunca hızlı ulaşmalısınız. Yoksa güçlenmemiş ekonominiz belini doğrultamadan tahtalı köyü boylar. Light Galley ve Galleyler çok sayıda etkili olsa da yeterli değiller. Sixth Rate Ship of Line'nin olmaması da küçük de olsa bir eksiklik yaratıyor. Ticaret gemileri ise ekonomi için elzem nitelikte.
Orta dönemde; Beylik Yeniçeri Tüfeklileri, hat piyadesi ve moral arttırıcı olarak orduda çok faydalı olacaklar. Fakat tecrübeli İsarelilerin de onlardan çok eksiği olduğunu söyleyemem. Bu dönemde asıl vurucu birim Beylik Bombacıları ve hemen sonrasında gelen Beylik El Topçu Bölükleridir. Düzgün kullanıldığında düşmanınıza verdiği zaiyat korkunç olabilmektedir. Tecrübeli Deliler varken Memlük Atlılarına pek ihtiyaç duyacağınızı düşünmüyorum. Batıda Memlük Atlıları yerine Boyarlar daha iyi bir seçenek gibi duruyor. Afrika'da Kahire Yeniçerileri, Beylik Yeniçerilerinin yerine geçebilecek dahi iyi bir tercih olarak gözüküyor. Ayrıca Libyalı Kuloğulları ise üstün bir dragoon birliği olarak harikalara imza atıyor. Afrika'da biraz batıya gittiğinizde Dohamey Amazonlarını piyade hattınızda kullanabilirsiniz. Fakat arkasına Cemaat Yeniçeri desteği vermeniz çok önemli. Topçu ve donanmanız ise bu dönemde olağan gelişimine devam ediyor.
Geç dönemde ise Avrupa tarzındaki birimleriniz ordunuzu domine etmeye başlıyor. Atlılarda ise Sipahiler şok süvarisi olarak düşmanınızın moralini ve formasyonunu çökertiyorlar. Anadolu'dan üretilebilen Kafkas Ağır atlıları ise oyunun en üstün atlılarından biri. Nizam-ı Cedit Yivli Tüfeklileri ise hafif piyade birlikleri olarak ulaşabileceğiniz en üst nokta. Bu dönemde gelen kuşatma topları ise Osmanlı Devletine kuşatma savaşlarında büyük bir üstünlük sağlıyor. Ne yazık ki Donanma konusunda Osmanlı Devleti ile Avrupa'nın Sömürge İmparatorlukları arasında aleyhimize gerçekleşen teknolojik gelişmeler ortaya çıkıyor.",58625,turkish
0,steam_reviews/1064310_APlacefortheUnwilling.json,66,1,"A Place for the Unwilling: Meet me on the corner of Kafka and Lovecraft, one block north of Dickens.

In A Place for the Unwilling, you control the main character who must navigate through a maze of city streets, alleys, docks and markets in a race against the clock to solve the mystery of your friend’s death, and uncover the hidden truth underlying the increasingly shadowy city. After 21 days the story ends, as each new day represents a limited opportunity to explore and discover as much of the story as you can, a pocket watch in the corner haunting your every move. You can talk to characters, obtain tasks, engage in trade, research books and newspapers, bet on literal rat races, find hidden rooms, and try to ingratiate yourself to one side of the class struggle, or the other. But you have to choose wisely how you spend your time and money, because you only get one chance before the story moves on, with or without you. 

Due to the rushed pacing and extremely fragmented storytelling, the narrative feels disjointed most of the time. It's as if one grand story was written down and then run through a shredder, with the pieces being sprinkled across a game map for the players to reconstruct. What this means is that there isn't a solid, cohesive or logical progression of discovery; no dramatic unfolding, or clever associative leaps to tie the story together; instead, it feels like you are piecing the plot together at random. On the other hand, there is a lot of story to be had in Unwilling. So much so that it's impossible to get it all in a single playthrough. And in the game's defense, that's the whole point, I think. You have time in those 21 days to befriend only a few of the game's many characters, and from each character you gain a different perspective on the main story. So in that regard, Unwilling is very prismatic, a seemingly simple story that changes depending on what angle you view it from. 

The main narrative is, on the whole, successful, though it does keep you at an uncomfortable distance for most of its length. There are multiple competing themes, with some meshing better than others. Life in the city, your interactions with people, and even your goals are fairly Kafka-esque; there's a sense of bureaucratic despair that looms over everything, and a certain impersonal terseness with which you engage in daily life. As the plot progresses and more of the mystery is revealed, hints of Lovecraft can be seen, with horror and sci-fi elements mentioned, along with some ominous secret knowledge. The game's setting and overall trappings have an unabashedly Dickensonian flair, with tales of orphans, street paupers, class struggles, scheming shopkeeps, gossipy spinsters and the general rough and tumble life amidst a sooty industrial society. This combination of horror and mystery fit brilliantly with the pseudo-Victorian setting, despite the impersonal qualities of the storytelling.

I love everyone's backstories and side quests. For that matter, I had more genuine interest and investment in the side characters and their plights than I did the main story. It's in these small, intimate and personal moments that Unwilling really shines.

Unwilling continually asks the player to take sides. Despite the city presenting a unified front, its people are anything but united. Class tensions continually boil over throughout the game, and even if you try to remain neutral, at some point you will have to choose a side. Ally with the rich and discover that they're just a bunch of petty, elitist complainers. Help the poor and find out that they're a bunch of ungrateful, ignorant bullies. Side with the City and realize just how much of an expendable pawn you really are. 

Another aspect of the game that metaphorically matches our modern world perfectly is how strangers are rendered. Every person in this city is drawn as a swirling angry scribble. Scribbles walk up and down the main street, scribbles line the bar to guzzle their drinks, scribbles wait impatiently for the horse drawn carriage. If you do happen to get to know the scribbly owner of a boutique French shop, for example, then the sketchy cloud will disappear and you'll see Florence, an actual person with a name, face and discernible identity. Such is real life too, I suppose. Surrounded by more and more people in our daily lives, they mostly remain unknowable scribbles. 

The character design is superb, and brings a hilarious and memorable face to each and every weird personality you encounter during your stay in the city. They're drawn in a more classically cartoony style, almost Max Fleischer-esque, and it helps them stand out from the sketchy backgrounds while still matching stylistically. The design and shape of the characters themselves is endearing and satirical at the same time. In many ways they remind me of old Punch and Judy puppets; exaggerated in all the right ways so as to elicit sympathy and a laugh in equal measures.

The sound effects are great as well and deserve a mention. They really evoke the mood of each neighborhood you wander through, from the raucous din of the rambling back alleys, to the posh murmur of an upper-class social club. There is enough variety in the music too, that each area has its own well-fitting theme, and is balanced so as to never over-power the evocative ambient sounds.

Not everything about playing Unwilling was a smooth stroll through the park, however. And that's another sticking point, literally. The collision detection in Unwilling is quite aggressive. I spent far too much time getting stuck on objects, set pieces, and NPC's. Tight doorways, narrow hallways, or debris on the road all represent potential roadblocks that will bring your character to a standstill. The same goes for the countless scribbly NPC's walking around; get within a hair's breadth of them and you'll come crashing to a halt.

Much like life, the plot of A Place for the Unwilling continues whether you make the right decision or not. In fact, the only way to fail is to make no decision at all. Time still moves on, the story still ends, but you just miss out on the rich details that made life worth living in the first place. So, forgo the race to the finish line, and instead savor each minor moment, each throw-away line of dialogue, each character quirk, follow each stray leaf as it blows down each cobblestone street visible under the flickering gaslight, lose yourself in the hum of a placid afternoon among the crickets and grass of a manicured public garden, become, willingly, a member of this city and its many varied people. For somewhere there is a place for each of us too; a place in family, or in community, among friends or colleagues, in our home or the cities and nations in which we live. For it's in the process of seeking this place that we may, however briefly, see the real world as possibly a little bit less scribbly.

[b]SELF[/b] is a Kafkaesque text-based adventure that unfolds on an interactive CRT screen. The game claims to draw inspiration from titles such as Undertale and Just Shapes & Beats, striving to combine text-based narrative and choices with a variety of gameplay mechanics.

It is a decent interactive fiction that will provide around two hours of gameplay. The game has an interesting albeit confusing storyline that successfully captures the player’s attention. However, it oversells itself with exaggerated claims of puzzles and bullet hell sections, which although fun, are not overly challenging and often feel like a side note that would be better marketed as a unique take on decision making in games. I would recommend the game as a narrative experience, particularly to fans of text-based adventures, but would ward off anyone looking for more action-packed or high octane gameplay.

0,steam_reviews/1074170_SELF.json,246,2,"[i] My Experience [/i]

For much of the time I was playing SELF, I was considering the metaphorical implications of the different images used in the game. The flooding water representing a memory that can no longer be repressed, and the sinking feeling associated with the vivid memory of someone who was once so close to you. The cracking screen, perhaps representing the growing ineffectiveness of using entertainment to avoid encroaching emotions.

What a disappointment, when, at the end, these images are revealed to be quite literal. [spoiler] The flooding water, instead of irrepressible emotion, simply referring to the weather on the night your father was killed. [/spoiler]

However, I did find the way that the other characters interact with you to be amusing. The only individuals which actually seem to listen to your character are the tall/thin and short/stumpy men that follow you around. Everyone else (your mother, King, the clown, the people that speak to you over church bells, the fellow student at school) ignores the requests you make of them and questions you ask them, only to ask you shortly thereafter ""what they can do to help."" It was frustrating, and a unique emotion to be induced by a game - it made me feel like I was on the phone with the customer service department at the local cable company. King buys you a soda after you tell him you don't want one, the clown gives you a balloon after you tell him you aren't interested, etc.

Outside of this interesting emotion provoked by the game, I didn't find much to appreciate. The mini-games that allow you to either face the past or avoid it were unengaging and repetitive, and the game featured a few typos as well (""take them were?"" vs. ""take them where?"" and ""reelection"" vs. ""reflection"").

I feel that I should note to potential players that I generally only play games of this type once. I'm not interested in playing through the same scenes over and over, doing slightly different things to uncover each of the game's seven (!?) endings. Not an awful effort, but ""My Name is You"" (which I've noticed is now F2P) is still the best ""Kafkaesque"" game around.",54,english

Ein beeindruckendes storylastiges Thriller-Adventure, das sich für mich als ein versteckter Juwel herausstellte und selbst nach den Credits weiter in meiner Psyche nach Antworten grub.

Man schlüpft in die Rolle von Frederick Russel, ein Wissenschaftler/Ermittler der sich mit einer kontroversen Technik befasst, die es mittels AI ermöglicht Erinnerungen und Träume von Menschen zu scannen und sichtbar zu machen. Allerdings ist dies noch sehr experimentell, wodurch menschliche Interpretation notwendig ist, um die von der AI konstruierten Umgebungen richtig zu deuten. Denn Erinnerungen können zerrissen und von Emotionen verzerrt sein. Sie können aus chaotischen Formen und surreale Verbindungen zwischen Orten, Gefühlen und Ereignissen gebildet sein. Und das ist meiner Meinung nach Playmestudio einfach großartig gelungen. Die realen Umgebungen sehen schon sehr gut aus, aber die surrealen Tiefen des Unterbewusstseins sind fabelhaft skurril, verzogen, beinahe kafkaesk. Und dies passend eingebettet in eine spannende Geschichte um einen mysteriösen Todesfall, menschliche Unzulänglichkeiten und psychologische Abgründe. 

Um tiefer vorzudringen muss man meist Umgebungsrätsel lösen, bestimmte Objekte finden/platzieren und Dialogentscheidungen treffen. Und hierbei wird man nicht an der Hand genommen. Man muss genau aufpassen, erkunden und interpretieren. Manche Spieler finden das zwar etwas zu chaotisch oder unklar, aber gerade diesen relativ breiten Interpretationsspielraum vieler Einzelheiten fand ich so grandios. Weil es zum einen, den experimentellen Charakter der Technologie unterstreicht, und zum anderen den Spieler sehr effektiv in die Rolle zwingt die Inhalte freier zu interpretieren. Selbst nachdem ich das Spiel durch hatte, konnte ich nicht aufhören mir über gewisse Dinge Gedanken zu machen und da es mehrere Enden gibt, habe ich es gleich nochmal durchgespielt.

Das einzige was ich zu bemängeln habe, wären die etwas mittelmäßigen bis schlechten Charakteranimationen, die aber nicht sehr stark ins Gewicht fallen, weil diese nur sehr begrenzt vorkommen und durch richtig starke Synchronsprecher ausgeglichen werden.

Für mich ein wirklich erstaunliches Erstlingswerk eines Indie Entwicklers, das wesentlich mehr Aufmerksamkeit und Lob verdient, als es bisher erhalten hat.",840,german

Yet we once again have a problem with variation. Cause the dialogue goes mostly one way or another. Either for or against something, and always on the extreme case.

0,steam_reviews/1091500_Cyberpunk2077.json,605778,4,"If you’re expecting the combat to raise the bar for next gen games everywhere, you’ll be disappointed. But if you’ve any interest in world building, and what the human imagination can do with visuals and storytelling, you’ll be blown away by this game. 

The artists and writers undoubtedly poured their hearts and souls into this. If I’d gotten 50% of the effort that went into the art and writing here, I would’ve still called this game a masterpiece. 

The undercooked combat and related gameplay mechanics will continue to evolve: I’m certain of that. The talent is there, and I believe they do love this game enough that they’ll spend the time to develop it. 
The writing, however, is in general excellent, and in some cases borders on phenomenal. It’s the best writing I’ve ever encountered in video games, and at times rivals the polish, wit and brilliance you’ll get from TV shows like The Sopranos or The Wire. 

Granted, it is uneven. There are some sections so childishly written that you can almost feel the writers’ brains turning to mush in the words, and even the deflated deliveries of the voice actors and actresses. This happens for maybe 5% of the game. 

The main culprits seem to be some early sections involving a character named Panam. Someone on the executive team must have insisted on “sexing up” some of the story scenes, even if it means skipping any natural lead up. And so Panam, and certain other female characters, are forced to break character, and even break every real woman’s character, and deliver some of the most cringe-inducing lines of dialogue when it comes to flirting with your main character V. This is the kind of dialogue a horny twelve year old boy might produce if forced to write a “romance scene” between a man and a woman, knowing nothing about subtlety or humour or restraint. 

Luckily there’s real chemistry elsewhere. In particular, Judy is one of the best-realised characters, in writing or voice acting, that I’ve encountered – if not the best. My last mission with her actually felt like a last outing with a real person that I’d miss when gone. 

There really are some impressively imagined characters in this game, and their stories show a lot of balls from the creative department. Some, especially one that involves a genuinely cool detective character, are pitch-black dark, but in no way contrived. The tone of the stories varies so much that I was rarely left bored, or feeling the writers had run out of steam for the 95% of the time they were firing on all cylinders. 

I think some of the narratives are Kafka-esque ingenious. There’s a fantastical set of stories about neurotic, suicidal AIs that was simply incredible. It made me think deeply about the various AIs with their sensory overstimulation, their feelings of freakishness and otherworldliness that humanised them in the way real people with various disorders and afflictions suffer through the same problems. 

That this kind of thing cropped up in a video game that allows you to slay enemies with a dildo-bat says a lot about the artistic variety that went into it. The crass and high-brow live side by side. Some of that crassness is intentional, of course, and fits the quirky tone of the game. And you know the phrase “sex sells”. Well, CD Projekt Red knows that too, and knows its largely male target audience will enjoy all the titillation, naked female bodies, skimpy girls’ clothing. I did. It just works, and has always worked in TV and film, even in the most “mature” works of art. I can safely say that whoever designed the girls’ asses likes girls’ asses – a lot. The game is filled with the most varied, perfectly sculpted female asses you’ll ever see. Though it did make me wonder where games are going as the plastic, uncanny-valley models become more lifelike and the dirty minded artists – aren’t we all? – play god with the girls’ bodies, dressing them how they like, animating them how they like.

The sleaze in Night City is mostly goofy and cartoony, tongue-in-check nonsense plastered on seedy advertising boards everywhere you turn. The story doesn’t have anything noteworthy to say on it, it’s just the way the place is, and I’m good with that.

As for V – excellent voice acting, but his near-complete absence of a background sticks out as an oddity. It didn’t really hurt the experience, but I always found it strange that V’s pal Jackie, and Jackie’s family and friends, seemed to be the only people in his life. It seemed like V was literally born just a year or two ago, a fully formed adult with no parents or history, and just enough time to make one friend and chill with that friend’s family for a bit.

Keanu Reeves, who dominates the main narrative and crops up everywhere in side missions, delivers his best performance – at least the best I’ve witnessed, which may not be saying much. The acerbic Johnny Silverhand is purposely portrayed as the most unlikable character in the game, and it’s a testament to Reeves’ ability that he carries this well throughout the game. Silverhand, like V, doesn’t get much character history or development. Except for very late in the game, he is little more than a set of snarls and sarcastic quips. I finished the game not even knowing why he is the way he is. But I didn’t care. There are many characters that have potential but are only partially fleshed out, or appear and then disappear almost in the same instant (particularly the villains, who receive virtually no development). The characters that are fleshed out more than make up for this. And Silverhand does get his “big moments” that pay off. A genuinely fantastic story, unique and, in many places, powerfully written and voice acted.

The gameplay is indeed the weakest part. The non-storied side-content that’s represented by little blue baseball bat icons on the map is as mindless and repetitive as it gets. I could only bring myself to slaughter the same set of goons and click the same “evidence box” so many times. There’s very little enemy variety, and they almost all follow the same patterns. Equip the mantis blades or a katana and you’ll be shredding through everything, including hulking mechs, in seconds. They don’t even have a counterattack. It’s still plenty of fun – I didn’t end up playing the game for the combat. And the shooting is so sluggish and bullet-spongey that I couldn’t bring myself to use any of the game’s guns. 

Driving is as good as I could’ve hoped for. Zipping around Night City on a motorbike never grows old. Shame that purchasing the various vehicles in the game is locked out until near the end (everything is overpriced, and you’ll have more practical things to spend your money on than cars that don’t impact your success in missions or fights). 

The storied side missions are superb, and set a new standard for interwoven narratives in games. The genius of the design is making nearly all of them connect to the main story, either thematically or through the appearance of recurring characters. They become “main stories” in themselves, often surpassing the quality of the real main story. It’s this kind of innovation, not all the fancy technical gimmicks that were promised, that really makes this game stand out from the pack.

Night City looks, for the most part, phenomenal. Even after 60+ hours, it still seemed fresh. Its imagination doesn’t always hold up – there are some bland sections, almost all of which exist on the perimeters. The Badlands where you’ll meet the somewhat forgettable nomads isn't a place you’ll want to stay too long, though it is fun to mow down cacti in a vehicle.

So, is it worth the buy? Ah, of course it is. You definitely get your money’s worth, even in its current undercooked state. The story is excellent and unique. The characters are some of the best conceived. Night City has an aesthetic unlike any you’ll have encountered elsewhere. And the girls have the best asses in existence. What more do you want?

0,steam_reviews/1091500_Cyberpunk2077.json,605778,4,"The gameplay is that of an FPS with RPG mechanics that doesn't get in the way of the action, e.g. bullet sponge problem.

The graphics are beautiful (if you have the equipment for it) with love of the craft reflected in minutiae like car interiors, faces, and wardrobes.

The music, voice acting, and audio effects are absolutely stellar and evoke the widest range of emotions I've ever heard from a single canon.

But none of these are the reasons to play this game.

This game is cyberpunk in its purest, most crystallized form.

It takes the desperation from Neuromancer, the despair of existence from Blade Runner, the dilemma of life from the Matrix, and the cynicism and pessimism of a Kafkaesque world gone mad and packages it into a digital $60 dose for a 50-100 hour high. Its lows are low - you're going to hellish places that don't exist in the real world ... yet. And the high is one of a kind - a desperate hope in the face of nihilism that would make Nietzsche proud. 

Every major cyberpunk theme is present in this game, with some distinct motifs to make it its own unique telling of a cyberpunk story. It's a trip into a world of high tech but low people that barely requires any suspension of disbelief by taking the underpinnings of the modern world and extending them to their logical conclusions. Every aspect of life that it can touch, it does touch in this story, with no commentary suspended nor dragged down by hyperbole. It goes as high as god, and past that into ascension into godhood, then all the way down to humanity's worst impulses - and unlike a lot of other prior attempts, there isn't shock for shock's sake. Every deep dark recess is completely organic and rational given the world that it exists in.

The moments of roaring triumph are vastly outnumbered by the shrieking despair, but by the end, you'll wish you had more time.

And you will grieve.

You'll first deny that this was anything more than a game. But you can't seem to shake this feeling that it was much more real than that - an omen of some kind.

Then you'll get angry. Why did CDPR mess this up so bad, why aren't there more patches, updates, DLC, anything at all to give you more time in that place.

You'll bargain with yourself. Maybe if I played this way, or tried that, I could see more, hear more, feel more, but it's not the same. You connected deeply to the cyberpunk soul, and game play adjustments don't even break the skin of its depth.

And then you realize - what you got, you're never going to get again. There's no other option left but to accept it, move on, and try to never look back.

When you're ready to uninstall the game for what you think is the last time, it dawns on you what those words meant:

A thing of beauty, I know
Will never fade away
What you did to me, I know
Said what you had to say
But a thing of beauty, I know
Will never fade away
And I'll do my duty, I know
Somehow I'll find a way

[b]Cybercons[/b]: Nearly everything else.

I had few expectations beyond ""another CDProjekt Red Game,"" and I was not disappointed in that respect. It is gorgeous, huge, and deeply broken in almost every way. It is a eurojank disasterpiece, transcendently weird and frustrating like no other game from this studio has ever been. Yes, even The Witcher (1).

[h1]The Big Bads:[/h1]

There is an overwhelming number of perks, yet all but a few seem superfluous and many seem to either not function or have no discernible purpose. Fundamental systems like armor rating appear to have little statistical value. Itemization is all over the map. Some weapons are worthless, while certain legendary gear is so strong it isn't even fun. Many equipment mods seem to not work at all, exasperated by CDPR's signature MMO-Lite leveled item and enemy system that was one of worst parts of the Witcher 3. There is an entire attribute score related to the crafting system, yet it is exceedingly difficult to find the most basic crafting diagrams outside random loot, and the process itself is a chore due to the clunky and uninformative UI (which is still much improved over The Witcher 3).

Combat is very basic despite the vast options - perks, equipment, skills, cyberware, mobility and scene design are sadly wasted on enemies with virtually no AI who either eat bullets to the face for breakfast or go down so fast you barely realized you were in a fight. Unless you intentionally cripple yourself, there doesn't seem to be a path where combat doesn't become hilariously easy quite early into the game, ruining the thrill of being a supercyber murdermachine when there are no challenges to be faced. Playing as a Netrunner was amusing but dull, as I could wipe dozens of foes from the map in seconds after laying eyes on a single goon or camera while crouched motionless in a corner or upon a rooftop, my enemies literally incapable of figuring out any means to find or fight me - simply standing in place while a disinterested god smote them down.

The deep-dive lore of Cyberpunk 2020 and immersive atmosphere of Night City are constantly spoiled by the same non-existent AI. Hordes of pedestrians who seem unable to process the most basic events jump in front of your vehicle as you drive near them in pathetic attempts to end their pointless meandering. Omniscient cops inexplicably teleport directly behind you and attempt to murder you for committing kafkaesque infractions like Standing Too Close to Them, Helping Them Not Get Killed by Violent Gang Members That Infest Every Block, Driving Close To Pedestrians While They Faint From Terror of Motorized Vehicles, and so on. Said Gang Infestations and their extermination sadly have no impact on your interactions with NPCs of associated gangs, further contributing to the sense of meandering emptiness that plagues a lifeless open world filled with pretty sights and little else.

The tone of the dialogue and narrative is similarly fractured, veering from friendly cinematic chats with cool friends to deeply unpleasant and unfun forced ""choices"" that leave little room for any actual roleplaying.  NPCs range from complex and convincingly human to jarring caricatures of race and gender. Moments of genuine sensitivity and character growth are unbalanced by droll and unnecessary crassness, slurs and yucky phobic treatments of sexuality that undermine even the superficially libertine world the art and character designs present. Worst of all, said yuckiness contributes nothing toward creating villians, social commentary or characterization - its just there, being gross for no reason. While the ""cyberpunk"" genre is inherently goofy in its noir edginess and excess, in this case it lacks imagination and purpose for building atmosphere, attitude or thematic importance.

[h1]The Silver Lining:[/h1]

Despite all the above, I had lots of fun and will probably keep playing. The main storyline is well-crafted and compelling, and there are many wonderful characters to get to know. Criticisms that the game isn't ""punk"" enough or has nothing to say seem to miss the point - the game world is immoral, violent, and desperately confused, and its characters often acknowledge how misguided and limited their presented ideals and beliefs are if you dig into their stories and challenge them when possible. Frustration arises when you are given no option to disagree with characters that the game forces you to like because V likes them, but most of the main cast has some redeeming quality or at least fascinating damage to pity. At the risk of assigning deep thoughts to a relatively shallow game, the more serious moments tend toward deconstruction of the genre itself.

Your avatar V is an intriguing mix of naivete and grit, and for every instance I felt railroaded by their sarcastic quips or states-the-obvious doofishness there was the perfect dialogue choice or insightful comment to pull me back into character.

If the game didn't constantly sabotage its own sense of immersion and struck some balance of gameplay and/or RPG-ness, its many flaws would be far less noticeable. Whether nor not its possible or worth the effort to fix its seemingly intractable problems (beyond the many superficial bugs and performance issues) remains to be seen.",10823,english

I was very excited when I first saw Monsters of Little Haven. I was a big fan of Nikita Kaf's previous release, My Name is You. My Name is You created a unique and surreal feeling for me, and remains one of the very few games I'd describe as Kafka-esque. I don't love visual novels, and perhaps I'm not the ideal player for this style of game, but I just couldn't get excited about what Monsters of Little Haven had to offer.

It is clear through the game's description that the developer would like you to play the game multiple times. For example, we are told that ""the main goal is to find the approach to all of [the family's secrets]"" and that the player has the ""opportunity to learn the history of the Murphy family from various perspectives."" However, I've just never been interested in this. I don't want to play through the game over and over, picking slightly different choices each time to incrementally reveal different story bits. I want to play through the game once, making the choice that makes the most sense to me, and then seeing what happens.

My Name is You had the same structure, but I felt satisfied with my story at the conclusion of my playthrough. This doesn't mean that I felt like I did the ""right"" thing (in either game), but that the game left me ruminating on what had transpired. In Monsters, the conclusion to my tale was far from compelling.

Perhaps some players don't mind seeing the same scenes over and over, but I can't count myself among them. I appreciated the graphical style of the game and the earnest delivery of the English lines by the voice actor, but overall I was underwhelmed.",75,english

No use reading this review, not a hardcore jrpg fan or a habitual game reviewer. Mostly using this as an exercise to arrange my own thoughts on the game and exude some of this enthusiasm. 

Finished my first run and exploring a few final routes with ng+. 

Story wise, it feels like an above average anime with good laughs, a decent level of emotional intelligence that doesn't fall into overly maudlin anime tropes (although there are some quite corny scenes) and a super interesting twilight zone vibe mixed in. The story was pretty apt at making you form bonds with characters and get attached to them, however it's almost bittersweet that the most interesting routes are adjacent to the story (loved the fox quests, talking with Death, helping neighbourhood animals, it's very reminiscent of Kafka on the Shore: surrealistic while founded heavily in trivial day to day human society). The final hour of the game is a little tame given the excitement of the climax but it didn't dampen too much my hype. If I had any gripe with the story and characters, it would be that romance options don't blend quite seamlessly into the rest of the plot. 
Otherwise, the main cast is perfect for the game and a special shoutout goes to the friend group events fixed in time such as camping or holidays trips, it does a great job at cementing a cast dynamic. 

Now, for gameplay: The leveling up of proficiency, the combat and most of all the passage of time in regards to acquiring S links are three gameplay mechanics that are pretty well interwoven together. They all play on uncertainty: How fast will time fly and how long do I truly have? How hard is it to level up to the next stat? How the hell do I make a matador with mahama? You progress through the game in a blind manner and little by little you start grasping how the gameplay truly works. It's pretty gratifying and rewards trying new things. The biggest hurdle for most players will likely be money and completionists will want to grind a lot for as much money as you can). 
Story is linked with gameplay: leveling up social ranks grants benefits, triggered through cutscenes that you might not be tempted to watch all over again in ng+. This encourages a grace period before delving back for a second run. 
Moreover, combat itself is very enjoyable and the rock paper scissor gameplay mixed with mastermind is not new here but well tuned here. If the game is not a perfect 10 it is because of the combat however: the game is not hard (once you get it, it's just a matter of not slipping and pressing the wrong button, at most you'll grind a bit to be able to take a hit better), but brutally uncaring. Simply being a little underleveled will punish you, as I just opened a chest and Optimus Prime burst out of it, hit me with a one shot kill and sent me on my way. Having yourself sent back to the beginning simply because an enemy used a light/dark move in their turn is grating, albeit very rare. 

What really shines in this game, however, is its ""presentation"". Its artistic style, twilight zone atmosphere, pacing and (ch)eery music give it an incredibly unique appeal that surpasses the usual bland oversaturated jrpg and the clinical, undaring pokemon games. It doesn't lean on personas like digimon leans on its cute or cool creatures (the main cast will almost never talk of personas, they're little more than jojo references in the story), but focuses rather on interpersonal intrigues, otherworldly situations and... trivial day to day. Through its music, overall style and mood, the game found its own little spot: the top.

The game's biggest asset is offering the player choices on how to interact with the unknown: unknown enemies, game mechanics, while keeping you wondering with numerous twists and turns in its story. Obviously the first run is going to be the most decisive one to form an opinion. 

I think it's fantastic. I'm not even sure whether or not I truly want to wring out every cutscene out of ng+, as perhaps leaving mystery is an even better way to remember the game. Silly notion probably.

Both are fine. 

""My Name is You"" is the second type — but the usability, unfortunately, belongs to the first type. It has no fast forward, and you have to click every slide to continue the story. Want to see a different path? Reach it again manually by replaying the chapter.

QoL features are not the most important aspect in games, but in text-based stories they kind of are, since the game has very little apart from text, music, and choices. And you are [i]not[/i] meant to play it once — there is imagery hidden in mutually exclusive parts (a la ""Dear Esther""), and the game expects you to explore them all... while tediously re-clicking slides.

As for the story itself, I liked both the plot and the writing (in Russian). The detached, half-surreal story of a terminally (?) ill,  suicidal man who is unsure if he's dying from his dreams and sees and/or kills his possible nonexistent double reads like a mixture of Alexander Grin, Kafka, and Camus, and I mean it in a good way. There are oddities here and there, but the non-linear nature of the story makes it even more fractured, which fits the genre. So I do recommend it, at least in Russian.

Yes, yes and triple yes.

[b]Is it worth my time and money?[/b]
Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.

[b]Is this game for anyone?[/b]
Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.

[b]Linear, open-world or something else?[/b]
Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, ""champion"" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.

[b]Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?[/b]
You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).

[b]Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?[/b]
The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.

[b]Audio design and soundtrack?[/b]
Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.

[b]Plot, story?[/b]
Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.

[b]How does the game run?[/b]
I have played and ""finished"" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the ""Auto"" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more ""crowded"" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to ""Low"" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.

[b]Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?[/b]
Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.

[b]Anything you didn't like?[/b]
Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a ""recomendation"", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.

[b]Final score?[/b]

Longer: The plot is alright, albeit a bit banal. I don't at any point really [i] care [/i] about any of the characters, what to do or if any of my choices could have a negative impact in any way. However, it's helped a lot by the voice actors. 

The combat suffers from some of the same issues I usually have with higher-level NWN campaigns: At high levels, you're basically a God. As a Sorcerer, as soon as you get to around level 18 everything becomes an absolute cakewalk. The last boss fight was over in seconds as a level 21/1 Sorc/Paladin. 

While some of the areas are nicely enough designed, they feel... Empty. I'd like some more side quests, some additional plot-lines to follow and so on, just to make them feel alive. The dungeon crawling through Zhentil Keep is nightmarishly boring, with map designs like something out of a Kafka novel. In addition, there's sometimes a lot of travelling back and forth for some quests, which becomes tedious in the long run.

However, there are also some epic fights, beautiful areas, nice music and it's all in all a great experience!

这是我很长一段时间以来，第一次感觉我没读懂整个游戏的核心设定是什么。没有中文倒是次要问题，关键这个游戏的设定真的挺跳脱的，都不说和一般“侦探”游戏贴近现实的设定不同了，就连在超自然、甚至超现实的领域里，本作也算走得很远的那一种了，新奇到我真的想不到任何有哪怕那么一丁点相似的设定风格。虽然我自己没能理出什么头绪来，不过我能肯定这个世界独特的设定、历史事件等，都是挺值得一看的，也基本上自洽。

我好不容易才整出来下面一段相对正常的开头剧情描述：在所谓的“天堂岛”（Paradise）24号上，整个“议会”（Council）在共处一室制造“完美的25号岛”（Perfect 25）的仪式后，全体被凶手杀害。在之前被流放的“调查怪胎”（Investigation Freak），主角Lady Love Dies被召回到已经封锁的岛屿上，解决这个“结束所有犯罪的犯罪”（The Crime to End All Crimes）。

以上这段话除了特殊名词看上去很多，看上去也很正常，可是我下面只需要举一两个例子，你就会知道这个世界多不正常了。比如说，“制造岛屿的仪式”是什么东西？这和他们的信仰有关，他们对宇宙中的一些存在——“神”（God）的信仰可以产生精神能量，而他们的目的也就是积聚精神能量让“神”们“复活”，以回报“神”的恩赐。为了达成这点，他们甚至可以强抓信众，指奴役一些人类并强迫他们信教以产生精神能量，还可以更进一步，通过献祭（就是那种献祭）来释放精神能量。

可是这些能量也会被宇宙中另一些存在——“恶魔”（Demon）觊觎，它们会造成“腐蚀”（Corruption），反正就是很严重的超自然灾难，而且最次也会通过杀人来抢夺精神能量。所以“神”最初的恩赐，是给予他们“制造岛屿”的技术，具体来说是创造新的现实的技术，以躲避恶魔腐蚀等灾难。当然之前还有什么“大背叛”（The Great Betrayal）之类的类似超自然世界大战的设定，也有反对他们信仰的“猎神者”（God Hunter）之类的人类阵营，所以也可以用来躲避他们。看起来有点像宗教战争，只不过是“神”真的存在的背景下的宗教战争。

我这里只是解释了本作设定的冰山一角，而且还仅仅是历史部分，你是不是觉得自己已经快要绕进去了？我开游戏的时候我也有这种感觉。就算本作并没有硬生生地给玩家塞设定，而是以一种还算温和的节奏给玩家慢慢讲述，然而......这游戏的设定还是太深奥了，对我来说。

如果你觉得这种有点玄学，有点科幻，又有点超现实的感觉很带感，那可以购买本作试试。

至于本作的核心剧情，也就是案件和阴谋，我觉得设计得非常巧妙，虽然主要案件本身看上去是老“暴风雪山庄”模式，所有角色都多多少少扯进了从历史到现今的多个案件交织而成的阴谋，听起来像《东方快车谋杀案》，不过相信我，本作还是玩出了新的花样，在这个部分里我就不剧透了。

[h1]奇特的开放性[/h1]

当我看到本作自称“开放世界侦探游戏”的时候，我人都傻了，这真的可能吗？从来没见过这样的。

好吧，实际上到最后，说本作是侦探游戏是可以理解的，毕竟主角是个侦探，但本作并不倾向于“推理”，也就是由玩家自己连接信息，找到结论，因为本作主角的智能电脑会自动给找到的证据和信息分类，最后都会明确地指向某人在某个案件中的嫌疑，并可以在最后的法庭阶段（这个在本节最后说）用来给该人定罪。说了这么多，我想说的是，本作并不能被称为一个“推理游戏”，就这一点来说，应该已经和《逆转裁判》、《弹丸论破》、《奥伯拉丁的回归》等游戏的核心非常不同了。

顺带一提，本作的UI和场景等都很有《弹丸论破》内味。之前我看其他人说本作和《弹丸论破》像，当时我还没玩过《弹丸论破》，现在玩完了一看，原来说的是这个。但在玩法上还是我刚才说的，并不注重“推理”，所以还是得注意一下。

如果让我来概括本作的核心玩法，我觉得大概是：开放世界探索解谜+视觉小说。从游戏一开始，整个小岛就可以任玩家探索，除了一些锁定的区域外（而且还不是《星际拓荒》等游戏里使用的“知识锁”，而是硬锁），玩家可以以自己的节奏，去和角色对话，去探索小岛中的各种建筑，去找到并勘查案发现场。没错，不光是勘查，你还得先找到现场在哪，包括现场周围可能留下线索的地方，都不是那么容易可以找到的。

其实吧，给我的感觉就是，虽然新奇是挺新奇的，可是玩多了之后，感觉也就那么回事。在纯关卡设计的角度上来说，我觉得本作比起其它开放世界前辈而言，并没有太多值得一提的，这也是挺遗憾的，毕竟这还是一款“侦探”游戏，而不是“平台跳跃”等很容易和开放世界结合，做出别的玩法的类型。

所以，总的来说，本作对这种新奇的组合做出了尝试，产生了比较奇妙的结果，不过对我个人而言，并没有碰撞出太多有意思的火花，可能对其他人来说要更好一些？

整个游戏的开放性还体现在结局上，也就是前面提到的“法庭阶段”。在这个最终的阶段，玩家需要用调查过程中得到的所有证据，为每一桩犯罪都指定一个嫌疑人。理论上你可以指定所有人，只不过需要证据才能定罪。而开放性则体现在，第一点，玩家不需要把所有潜在的线索都调查完，或者把所有的证据都收集完，才能开始法庭阶段，正相反，几乎游戏一开始，玩家就可以开始法庭阶段了；第二点，玩家在法庭过程中，有些犯罪可以被定罪的嫌疑人也不只有一个。换句话说，最后法庭认定出的“真相”，其实不一定是确确实实“正确”的，也不一定能完全解释所有角色的动向。这种开放和一般侦探游戏中的原则之一——“真相只有一个”看上去是相悖的，我觉得这正是本作想要做到的一种感觉。

既然“真相”和“正义”都不是绝对的，所以如果你觉得正义还没有被伸张，游戏结局之后还有一个环节：[spoiler]如果达成了一些条件（据说是把最初的被告人Henry Division的嫌疑全部洗清），那么除了在庭上被处决的犯人外，玩家也可以一一决定剩下角色的命运：啥都不做、处决或流放[/spoiler]。就......挺奇妙的，感觉也很契合整个游戏想要表达的那种感觉。不过对这种有着哲学深度的问题我就没什么可说的了，大家可以自己思考。

[h1]我对剧情的理解（重大剧透警告）[/h1]

由于本作的世界观太过庞大，所以我就只说说我是怎么理解本作案件方面的核心阴谋的，以及这种设计是怎么和游戏设计结合产生奇妙的效果的。

[spoiler]首先，所有事情最真正的真相还是只有一个，只不过有些案件的犯人并不唯一。而且找到真相是一回事，执行正义又是另一回事，毕竟在法庭被视为有罪就一定会被处决，没有任何折衷方案，而一个人到底罪至不至死，这又是很相对的一件事了。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]根据其他一些玩家的整理以及我个人的理解，本作的核心阴谋有[b]两个[/b]。一个是Carmelina的阴谋，一个是Witness的阴谋。这两个阴谋的结果都是谋杀议会，但动机和过程都完全不同，游戏中也貌似没有解释其中到底哪个才是最后成功的那一个，这也就是为什么，如果玩家在法庭中只揭露其中一个阴谋的全貌，就还会有很多可疑的地方没有解释。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]大概来看，Akiko，Yuri，Dainonigate是Carmelina的共犯，Lydia，Sam，Crimson（某种程度上）是Witness的共犯。从严重程度上来看，前者付诸的行动最多，布局最严密，下手也最狠：Carmelina从24号岛诞生起就偷偷建立“跨次元走廊”；在本次事件前25年就偷偷和Eyes生下Dainonigate，训练他成为只有杀人一个目的的武器；在本次事件前10年，找到Eyes另一个私生子Henry，让Yuri把他推到恶魔附身的深渊之中；Henry被恶魔附身后，为了让他在以后能背锅，在Henry的恶魔没啥反应时，Carmelina亲手杀害除魔师Grace Bloodlines，并让Akiko用权力掩盖真相；本次事件中，先是让Akiko协助Henry逃脱，突破第一道神圣封印，只不过中间因为Akiko不愿牺牲自己的士兵而将他们和囚犯偷换了，反而引起了怀疑；然后，Yuri通过杀害K. HX得到第二道神圣封印的钥匙，并带着Carmelina通过“跨次元走廊”带来的Dainonigate穿过封印；Dainonigate继承了议会议员Eyes的血，又被混入了Crying Grudge神的血肉，于是顺利通过第三、四道神圣封印；杀害议会后，Dainonigate通过“跨次元走廊”逃脱，Yuri和Akiko围绕Henry进一步伪造了很多证据，栽赃Henry。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]至于Witness这边，倒没什么高深的布局。首先，利用自己脑中接受到的死亡尖叫电波，在天堂门岛上安装装置，试图刺激Henry的恶魔苏醒；第一道封印，Lydia从议会大楼屋顶向下走到阳台，将维护用的通道打开，绕过门口的守卫；第二道封印，Witness先让Crimson从K. HX那拿到钥匙（利用K. HX对Crimson的痴迷），再让Lydia在悬崖上远程启动沙滩上的机关，得知密码；第三道封印，用Sam从医生诊所里偷到议会议员Kafka的血液，顺利通过；第四道封印，用Witness从Crying Grudge神那里取得的神的血肉通过；最后，他们将秘密研究的杀手恶魔装在箱里，在事件两天之前就放在了案发现场，案发当天，Witness用电话远程开启箱子，就可以杀害议会。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]而剩下的医生Doom Jazz其实也没有那么无辜。他和Eyes的交情让他协助销毁了Eyes两个孩子（Henry，Dainonigate）的出生记录。Sam从他的诊所里能偷到血也一定程度上是因为他的失察。虽然不完全无辜，不过确实是最无辜的一个了。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]至于各个角色的动机等其它细节，游戏里案件资料的部分就已经解释得很清楚了。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]以上就是我个人的总结，如果有漏的可以提醒我。所以我们可以看到，两个核心阴谋都有非常完善的计划，因此最终到底是哪个成功，游戏没有说清楚的话，那还真的说不太清楚。真相就是这些，而到底要给哪些角色定罪处决，是另一回事。要我说，所有的角色在他们进入这个扭曲的社会的时候开始，从默认对“公民”的绑架、奴役和献祭开始，就已经有“原罪”了，所以这个案件被叫做“结束所有犯罪的犯罪”，还是让人若有所思。[/spoiler]

[spoiler]这种核心阴谋的设计就让这个游戏的开放性显得非常地奇妙了。游戏中的所有证据，玩家有可能会以为这些都属于一整个大的阴谋，而在玩家意识到有两个互相分离的阴谋时，这种感觉真的是，非常的奇妙。我个人其实......很惭愧，我是在通关游戏后去看了其他人的讨论我才意识到这一点的，这立刻让我回来多写了这一个部分，也就是我对剧情的理解。[/spoiler]

大家也可以和我分享你们的看法。那么就这样。

[h1]总结[/h1]

总而言之，本作就像我之前所说的，是一款非常奇特的作品。如果我之前的描述有任何一点让你感兴趣了，那你可以尝试一下这款作品。

哦对了，之前忘记说了，本作的音乐是真的很不错，推荐买OST。

结论：[b]推荐[/b]，从剧情上来说[b]强烈推荐[/b]。",722,schinese

Paradise Killer is a bizarre contradiction of open-world and visual novel. The vapor wave aesthetic  and otherworldly setting creates a paradoxically beautiful nightmare for players to unpack at their own place as they freely traverse the environment and read the snippets of side content therein. Disguising itself as a murder mystery with a climatic trial (a nod to influences like Phoenix Wright and Danganronpa), the true mystery for players to unpack is the world in which they are placed. The player has free reign from the jump to meet characters, explore the world, discover evidence, and contemplate the ever increasing nods to living in an eldritch horror that is universally referred to as Paradise. Gradually, explorers of the a narrative of class conflict and the literal sacrifice of a working class being necessary to sustain an infinite wonderland that only benefits and oligarchical class forever suspended above it.  There is a killer in paradise, but players are left on their own to consider whether the paradise itself ought to be killed. 

At any time when satisfied with their world exploration they may begin the closing trial sequence of the game. The trial sequence is deeply permutable based on evidence you choose to provide, and the only reward for the player's presentation of the case is being personally satisfied with the result. My initial impression was the lack of content following the trial left some closure to be desired, but with some distance I recognize the trial serves fantastically as a Kafka-Camus fueled critique of the criminal justice system, highlighting the players role as a both an investigator and a prosecutor in the construction of what the institution of law will consider valid and factual.  There are killers in paradise all the time, but the judge only manifests into  being when the ruling class is under assault. All-in-all, the closing sequence of the game functions as a grim reminder how the edifice of law only seeks to perpetuate the system that bestows its own power. 

Shout outs to the tiny team that made this game for doing so much with so little. This game has a lot to think about conceptually as a story and as a ""game"" (or rather, how agent-driven mechanics create a self-driven narrative experience). Many thanks to everyone involved in behind the game.",960,english

[url=https://le-sanglier-des-yvelines.blog4ever.com/death-and-taxes-1]ici[/url].

Le titre fait référence à un célèbre aphorisme attribué, à tort, à Benjamin Franklin : ""In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes"" (Dans ce monde, rien n'est certain sinon la mort et les taxes). Nous incarnons donc une Faucheuse employée de bureau, bien éloignée de la légendaire camarde arpentant les campagnes, juchée sur une charrette grinçante, en emportant les âmes des défunts. Notre vie professionnelle est aussi répétitive et ennuyeuse que celle d'un expert-comptable du Ministère des Finances.

La journée commence. Ascenseur. J'arrive au bureau. Je traite les dossiers du jour et les faxe au patron. Ascenseur. Je monte faire mon rapport quotidien. Ascenseur. Je descends voir ce que Mortimer a en stock. Ascenseur. Je vais me coucher. Et ça recommence comme ça tous les jours de la semaine, puis du mois. On pourrait résumer ça par un ""Ascenseur, boulot, dodo"" répété ad nauseam.

Pour être honnête, l'aspect très administratif et très routinier m'a pas mal dérouté la première fois. J'ai eu beaucoup de mal à rentrer dans le jeu. Je m'attendais à un jeu proche de Papers, Please, avec des choix cornéliens lourds de conséquences et un impact émotionnel fort mais à aucun moment je n'ai senti de nécessité particulière à retenir une option plutôt qu'une autre dans le traitement de mes dossiers. Les conséquences de mes décisions se résumant à un entrefilet dans les actualités du lendemain, consultables sur mon téléphone professionnel. Aucun attachement aux personnes que je devais épargner ou achever. Ni empathie, ni sympathie pour ces mortels sans consistance.

J'ai fini le jeu une première fois avec une mauvaise fin, sans savoir vraiment pourquoi j'avais eu cette fin et sans avoir le sentiment que mes choix y étaient pour quelque chose. Cependant, j'avais la désagréable impression d'être passé à côté du sens du jeu et de son message.

J'ai donc récidivé et bien m'en a pris car c'est le genre de jeu qu'il faut refaire maintes fois pour en saisir la portée. Death and Taxes est un jeu proustien : il ne se joue pas, il se rejoue. On comprend dès la deuxième tentative que le jeu a été pensé pour être rejoué : les objets acquis dans les tentatives passées sont conservés et les informations obtenues débloquent de nouvelles options de réponses permettant, et c'est heureux, de raccourcir certains dialogues.

En rejouant, on saisit mieux la critique acerbe, presque kafkaïenne, de la bureaucratie défaillante :

    - Les chefs n'expliquent pas tout, notamment le sens et l'utilité des tâches confiés, car ils méprisent leurs subalternes.
    - Les règles sont floues et les manquements sont peu sanctionnés.
    - Un chef ou un employé peuvent très bien servir leur intérêt personnel sans que cela ne soit sanctionné.
    - Le salaire arrive parfois en retard. Certaines primes et augmentations sont accordées en fonction des résultats, d'autres en fonction de critères obscurs, probablement arbitraires.
    - Le vocabulaire employé est volontairement technocratique et déshumanisant.
    - Le politiquement correct est étouffant et inefficace.
    - Rapports quotidiens et évaluations hebdomadaires.
    - L'argent gagné est aussitôt investi dans des gadgets de bureau inutiles (en tout cas au premier abord) ou purement cosmétiques.
    - Les technologies que l'administration utilise sont obsolètes.

Pour prendre un exemple plus précis : tous les pronoms des dossiers traités sont non-genrés. En anglais, ""he"" et ""she"" sont ainsi remplacés par ""they"". C'est grammaticalement correct depuis plusieurs siècles bien que peu usité et la raison invoquée par notre supérieur hiérarchique est d'éviter les discriminations fondées sur le genre. L'intention est louable mais la conséquence est une confusion fréquente pour savoir si l'on parle au singulier ou au pluriel. Lors de ma première tentative, cela m'avait particulièrement agacé.

Je ne suis pas le seul puisque la question revient souvent sur les forums. Un des développeurs a répondu que ce n'était pas une position politique mais faisait partie de l'expérience de jeu. Je comprends alors que cette règle, dans l'univers du jeu, est volontairement absurde puisque le principe même du métier de Faucheuse est de discriminer selon divers critères pour user de notre droit de vie ou de mort. Il est idiot de masquer le genre et l'origine ethnique puisqu'une photo et un nom sont présents dans tous les dossiers. C'est peut-être même pire puisque si une Faucheuse souhaite discriminer selon le genre, elle le fera selon l'expression de genre et non l'identité de genre.

Et c'est exactement la même chose pour l'origine ethnique : là aussi, le politiquement correct échoue à supprimer les possibilités de discrimination : la simple absence de mention de l'origine ethnique n'est pas suffisante puisqu'il y a une photo. Il y a aussi une multitude d'autres critères de discrimination, dont on peut questionner la légitimité, qui sont bien présents dans les dossiers : l'âge, la situation familiale, la profession, la spiritualité, la moralité, le casier judiciaire, etc.

Le jeu pose ainsi plusieurs questionnements et laisse le joueur expérimenter pour tenter de trouver sa réponse. Il y a une volonté assumée de ne pas nous donner les clés de compréhension tout de suite ce qui est frustrant dans un premier temps mais se révèle instructif et formateur sur le long terme, notamment quand les mécaniques de jeu deviennent plus claires.

    - Quel est le rapport que nous entretenons à l'autorité ? Quid en cas de conflits d'autorités ?
    - Quelle est notre définition du bien et du mal ? La fin justifie-t-elle les moyens ?
    - Quels sont nos critères de discrimination ? Sont-ils moraux ? Utilitaristes ?",2080,french
0,steam_reviews/1166290_DeathandTaxes.json,3998,5,"Vous incarnez un bureaucrate chargé d'épargner ou de tuer les mortels. Chaque jour, votre chef vous fait parvenir une série de dossiers de mortels indiquant leur âge, leur profession, leur situation familiale et une petite description de leur mode de vie, accompagnés de consignes : tuer tant de soignants, de personnes âgées de moins de 50 ans, etc. Et chaque soir, votre chef de service vous reçoit pour faire un bilan.
Selon que vous avez rempli ou pas vos objectifs (dont certains sont secrets), vous bénéficiez de primes plus ou moins importantes. 
Votre chef essaye également de vous faire réfléchir sur votre fonction et tente de vous influencer pour vous rallier à son projet de destruction du monde.
Enfin, le lendemain, vous aurez un aperçu des conséquences de vos choix à travers les actualités.

Avec une direction artistique plutôt réussie et une ambiance un peu kafkaïenne et surréaliste (avec de nombreuses références culturelles), ce jeu peine cependant à convaincre vraiment. Les choix ne sont finalement pas si cornéliens que cela, dans la mesure où les conséquences des décès sont trop manichéennes et attendues : tuer un homme d'affaire véreux sera presque toujours positif pour le devenir du monde et sauver un infirmier altruiste sera positif. Les conséquences des choix sont prévisibles, donc peu marquantes.

Nous sommes par conséquent face à un jeu qui aurait pu être fascinant et qui n'est que sympathique et finit dans une sorte de demi-indifférence par manque de brutalité. Le jeu est trop câlin, pas assez rugueux, pas assez exigeant, trop mou.

Vor dem Gesetz

Vor dem Gesetz steht ein Türhüter. Zu diesem Türhüter kommt ein Mann vom Lande und bittet um Eintritt in das Gesetz. Aber der Türhüter sagt, dass er ihm jetzt den Eintritt nicht gewähren könne. Der Mann überlegt und fragt dann, ob er also später werde eintreten dürfen.

»Es ist möglich«, sagt der Türhüter, »jetzt aber nicht.«

Da das Tor zum Gesetz offen steht wie immer und der Türhüter beiseite tritt, bückt sich der Mann, um durch das Tor in das Innere zu sehn. Als der Türhüter das merkt, lacht er und sagt:

»Wenn es dich so lockt, versuche es doch, trotz meines Verbotes hineinzugehn. Merke aber: Ich bin mächtig. Und ich bin nur der unterste Türhüter. Von Saal zu Saal stehn aber Türhüter, einer mächtiger als der andere. Schon den Anblick des dritten kam nicht einmal ich mehr ertragen.«

Solche Schwierigkeiten hat der Mann vom Lande nicht erwartet; das Gesetz soll doch jedem und immer zugänglich sein, denkt er, aber als er jetzt den Türhüter in seinem Pelzmantel genauer ansieht, seine große Spitznase, den langen, dünnen, schwarzen tatarischen Bart, entschließt er sich, doch lieber zu warten, bis er die Erlaubnis zum Eintritt bekommt. Der Türhüter gibt ihm einen Schemel und läßt ihn seitwärts von der Tür sich niedersetzen.

Dort sitzt er Tage und Jahre. Er macht viele Versuche, eingelassen zu werden, und ermüdet den Türhüter durch seine Bitten. Der Türhüter stellt öfters kleine Verhöre mit ihm an, fragt ihn über seine Heimat aus und nach vielem andern, es sind aber teilnahmslose Fragen, wie sie große Herren stellen, und zum Schlusse sagt er ihm immer wieder, daß er ihn noch nicht einlassen könne. Der Mann, der sich für seine Reise mit vielem ausgerüstet hat, verwendet alles, und sei es noch so wertvoll, um den Türhüter zu bestechen. Dieser nimmt zwar alles an, aber sagt dabei:

»Ich nehme es nur an, damit du nicht glaubst, etwas versäumt zu haben.«

Während der vielen Jahre beobachtet der Mann den Türhüter fast ununterbrochen. Er vergißt die andern Türhüter, und dieser erste scheint ihm das einzige Hindernis für den Eintritt in das Gesetz. Er verflucht den unglücklichen Zufall, in den ersten Jahren rücksichtslos und laut, später, als er alt wird, brummt er nur noch vor sich hin. Er wird kindisch, und, da er in dem jahrelangen Studium des Türhüters auch die Flöhe in seinem Pelzkragen erkannt hat, bittet er auch die Flöhe, ihm zu helfen und den Türhüter umzustimmen. Schließlich wird sein Augenlicht schwach, und er weiß nicht, ob es um ihn wirklich dunkler wird, oder ob ihn nur seine Augen täuschen. Wohl aber erkennt er jetzt im Dunkel einen Glanz, der unverlöschlich aus der Türe des Gesetzes bricht. Nun lebt er nicht mehr lange.

Vor seinem Tode sammeln sich in seinem Kopfe alle Erfahrungen der ganzen Zeit zu einer Frage, die er bisher an den Türhüter noch nicht gestellt hat. Er winkt ihm zu, da er seinen erstarrenden Körper nicht mehr aufrichten kann. Der Türhüter muß sich tief zu ihm hinunterneigen, denn der Größenunterschied hat sich sehr zuungunsten des Mannes verändert.

»Was willst du denn jetzt noch wissen?« fragt der Türhüter, »du bist unersättlich. «

»Alle streben doch nach dem Gesetz«, sagt der Mann, »wieso kommt es, daß in den vielen Jahren niemand außer mir Einlaß verlangt hat?«

Der Türhüter erkennt, daß der Mann schon an seinem Ende ist, und, um sein vergehendes Gehör noch zu erreichen, brüllt er ihn an:

»Hier konnte niemand sonst Einlaß erhalten, denn dieser Eingang war nur für dich bestimmt. Ich gehe jetzt und schließe ihn.«",6661,german

  wurde die Stadt wegen den Maschinen evakuiert

   allerdings irgendwann komplett als Spielelement aufgegeben werden, einfach zu wenig Abwechslung
- Kämpfe insgesamt nur Durchschnitt, s. KI Verhalten
- Nora als Waffenexpertin wirkt unglaubwürdig, eine Stealthoption sowie der Fokus auf Survival würde dem Spiel mehr 
  Spannung verleihen. Spannung ist zu  Beginn, bis man zig Waffen mit sich rumschleppt auch noch vorhanden, ebbt dann 
  aber zunehmend ab, einfach weil die Gegner nicht sehr clever agieren.
- riesenhafte Figur aus dem Trailer, die durch die Stadt wandelt, kommt nicht vor
- Probleme mit der Bildrate
- Spiel ließ sich zwischendurch nicht mehr starten, nach De- und erneuter Installation ging es allerdings wieder


FAZIT: 70%

Ergänzend muss man sagen, dass die erste Stunde bis zu den ersten Außenarealen wirklich großartig inszeniert ist. Unglaubliche Atmosphäre. Man will unbedingt wissen, wo Walter geblieben ist und was es mit der Stadt auf sich hat. Hätte man da die Spannung weiter nach oben geschraubt, wäre das ein überdurchschnittlich guter Titel geworden. Leider bleibt der komplette Mittelteil mit den Shooterabschnitten und den Aufgaben wie z.B. Sicherheitssysteme abschalten, um auf Brücke zu gelangen, Tor öffnen, um mit der Eisenbahn weiterfahren zu können, profan.

0,steam_reviews/1186740_KyleisFamousCompleteEdition.json,1285,2,"EDIT: 
Response from Developer rectified most of my critisism and opinion previously posted was indeed misinformed at least in parts.

In light of this I'm changing review to positive.

To be more concrete:
I agree with Developer that there were additions for visuals and unlockables for both F2P and paid players and that's exactly my point in original review - These overhauls including Voiceacting, Workshop and Twitch support shouldn't distinct playerbase between F2P and Paid one and generally considered as free additions hence they shouldn't add to the final cost per se.

I've totally missed opportunity to get COMPLETE Edition for free as DLC owner. My bad. It could've been communicated better though. Mentioning of this on storefront or in the original News post commemorating COMPLETE Edition release could've done much better job than pinned post in Discussions. Thanks to Developer's answer that's been rectified.

My critism on upgrade options totally missed the spot. Being unaware of option to receive key as DLC Owner I expected to see distinct option to upgrade on storefront with respect to already bought content. With offer mentioned above this would've been inferior and redundant option.

I'd argue that written content was doubled (IMO feature upgrades and additions shouldn't be added to this estimate as I've already highlighted). Written content was nonetheless greatly expanded and sheer amount of it is greater than both DLC combined. I'd say it's on par with base game and can can be considered as fully-fledged expansion. Guess this disagreement still stands.

P.S.: I may have been too harsh in opinion on ""fun factor"" but I'll leave it as it was. It might have been distorted due to other then-perceived shortcoming and I'm unable to change it at the time. Guess you should educate yourself from other reviews on this.

Original review:
While there are undeniably content and feature upgrades in Complete Edition and quality of content is on par with original according to other reviews I find bussiness pactices of Developer/Publisher worrisome and would advise to at the very least scrutinize and research developed/published products by this entities before buying.

I'll highlight my perception of the game in parts with TLDR an the end.

Please note that a lot of people found this game hilarious and ""a must buy"" in all sincerity but I'd argue that should be put in context with regards to the review date and content available at the time and maybe pricing at the time.  

Release timeline:
18 November 2019 - Kyle is Famous released as F2P with fairly easy achievements stack. It's not only easy to 100% it adds to your library. Parts of community embraced it and accelerated it's spread among steam users: Achievement Hunters and those who wish to expand their Library.

13 December 2019 - DLC Kyle is Santa released without prior announcement (To my knowledge, please correct if I'm wrong) - New achievements added and are behind a paywall. Paywall is arguably low at about 10% of current Complete Edition price. My thoughts at the time: People like it why not. It's been a month since release and I should've chosen better, before 100%-ing it so soon. It screws me as achievement hunter but developer made a good job and delivering more. Why should it go unpaid?! But Achievement Hunters got screwed, Library Expanders weren't.

17 april 2020 (4 months later) - DLC Kyle is Hotdog released without prior announcement (To my knowledge, please correct if I'm wrong) - New achievements added and are behind a paywall. Paywall is on par with previous DLC (Low). My thoughts at the time: Dev have a passion for the game. They can and want to expand it. It's alright to pursue their decision and completelely understandable, But Achievement Hunters got screwed, Library Expanders weren't.

2 october 2021 (1 year 6 months later) - Kyle is Famous COMPLETE released without prior announcement (To my knowledge, please correct if I'm wrong) - New achievement added, all previous achevement nulled, Steam sees this change as iterative update, but playerbase while not locked form previously bought content, meta-wise considered as unpaid customers. Steam Average Game Completion screwed and lowers for all paid and unpaid customers (Meaning both Achievement Hunters and Library Expanders are screwed at the very least). Original F2P  becomes non-existant.  There are no options to upgrade for paid customers and there is another paywall at least 3 times higher than both previous DLC combined.

TLDR: While product definitely got it's audience and can be considered quality writing product  (since there are no other aspects to it), I won't advise to purchase it any discount for achievement hunting purposes or for apprectiating writing. If you see promise and nothing more in videos and screenshots - skip it, it won't get better. If you're aching for something hilarious and absurdous pick up a book from Terry Pratchet if you up to something fun or from Franz Kafka if you wanna be depressed and conflicted. If you're delighted and laughting out of limits from screenshots and videos - that's you'r piece of cake, consider buying it at discount.

My main highlight is that THIS IS THE GAME FOR THE EVENING AT MOST. NOT THE GAME YOU SUPPORT DISREGARDING PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER PAYWALLS AMONG THE PATH OVER YEARS. IMO exploiting Steam mechanics are anti-consumer, counter-productive and disrespectful for paid and unpaid customers strategy and it should not be welcomed.

N.B.: I've yet to review amount of content added in COMPLETE, but quick not 100% accurate review revealed that game 
(in terms of added content) should cost half of it's current price (In regards to now removed DLC costs). And other half of pricing is an added cost for Quality of Life (QoL) changes which even greediest studious in the World consider as free updates. Please keep it in mind",597,english

0,steam_reviews/1245620_ELDENRING.json,677754,3,"Elden Ring, a creation that might as well have sprung from the quill of J.R.R. Tolkien himself, starts with an introduction as grand as Shakespeare's Globe on opening night. One could almost imagine Aristotle, donned in digital armour, decreeing, ""The unexamined game is not worth playing,"" before pushing you into the tumultuous fray.

The graphics are a sublime feast for the eyes, a kaleidoscope of colours and forms, dancing across the screen like Sir Francis Drake's ships on a churning sea. If Van Gogh were alive and in possession of a gaming console, he'd no doubt be sat there, in his faded sunflower-patterned boxer shorts, joystick in hand, wide-eyed at the spectacle of artistry in motion.

Elden Ring's gameplay weaves between the methodical, strategic precision of a chess match with Kasparov to the riotous tumult reminiscent of a Marx-inspired proletarian uprising. One moment, you're tip-toeing around gargantuan foes like a veritable digital Fred Astaire, the next, you're wielding your weaponry with the fiery zeal of a thousand charging Boudiccas.

The narrative, dear reader, takes centre stage. It is a tapestry more intricate than Chaucer could've dreamt up on his most imaginative of Canterbury jaunts. Characters ebb and flow through the story, their dialogue as sharp and witty as Wilde on a caffeine high, their motivations as deep and tangled as a Kafkaesque nightmare.

Yet, like a double-edged Excalibur, Elden Ring has its sharper moments. The game's difficulty can spike like a rogue plot twist in a Conan Doyle mystery. One moment, you're feeling invincible, the digital Alexander the Great of the pixelated realm, the next, you're a digital King Lear, railing at the cruelty of your fate while the digital storm roars around you.

The sound design deserves a standing ovation. It's as if Bach, The Rolling Stones and John Williams decided to form a supergroup and compose an acoustic epic. It's a soundtrack that captures the heart, resonating triumph during victorious moments and plucking the heartstrings in the sombre ones.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is akin to a fine British pie. While its crust may occasionally crack and its filling may sporadically ooze, the overall experience is one that will linger in your memory like a tune you can't shake. As Nietzsche might say, ""That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."" In Elden Ring, that which doesn't kill you, gives you another chance to die in a more spectacular manner.",13439,english

0,steam_reviews/1262350_SIGNALIS.json,7967,1,"An old-school survival horror game that shoots for the stars and nails its dense narrative, and the ""dense"" part is very much defining for Signalis. Your enjoyment will be proportional to how much you enjoy analyzing its messages, meanings, and events, as nothing is as it seems, and there is a lot to chew on. You are not paying for just a piece of software, but for a contradictory and macabre art piece that will live in your head rent-free for quite some time.

The plot's presentation is unorthodox and often seems to walk a thin line between pretentious gibberish and a great story. Its flashing images are confusing, its use of several different languages seems pointless, and uncountable references to other works of fiction, including animes, books, and movies, make you feel like you can never fully grasp the message. Despite the kafkaesque chaos, the narrative is cohesive and successfully transmits the game's ideas to a staggering degree; it feels like you shouldn't understand what the point is, but you do, and you're not sure how. And you think about it and speculate some more, and it makes more sense. This is the hallmark of great works and is something seldom achieved in any media, let alone video games.

There is zero chance something this interesting and cryptic would ever be produced by the Triple-A industry, so it brings me great joy to see its success; a success all the more relevant in a world where Marvel movies and similarly empty corporate media have taken over our culture. The unfortunate truth is that different and meaningful experiences like Signalis are scarce and precious, coming around maybe three to six times a year. If you want at least a chance at something that will resonate with you and be memorable, you should definitely buy this game.

[Post Void] is a fever dream. It's a squigglevision, Kafkaesqe colorful nightmare. But what exactly [i]IS[/i] [Post Void]? 

[h2]Fast-Paced FPS Rogue-Lite Action[/h2]
On its surface, [Post Void] might look all flash and no substance. Even if that were true, the flash is enough to make it worth the low price of admission. But the game offers more than a feverish art style.

One part rogue-lite, one part corridor shooter, and a simple dash of time attack make up the soul of [Post Void]'s gameplay. You start the first level equipped with only a pistol. Your objective is to shoot your way through a maze of narrow corridors to the glowing portal at the end of the level. You then get to choose one of three random upgrades and jump right into the next map.

What makes [Post Void]'s gameplay loop challenging, rewarding, and above all [i]fun[/i], is each level is both procedurally generated and progressively more difficult than the last. Adding to this is a constantly draining health bar, represented by the idol your character holds in their left hand. Killing enemies is the only way to fill the idol. This creates a tense, pressing need to quickly gun down enemies and always move forward. 

Failure to do so leads to death, sending you back to the very first level. Points are awarded based on your accuracy, enemies killed, headshots, and the level you reached. 

Rinse. Lather. And repeat as desired. 

[h2]Juicy Gunplay[/h2]
Fortunately, this frantic action is complemented by simple yet satisfying shooting. Guns handle tight, their recoil feels weighty, and crisp pixelart animations offer juicy impacts - heads pop and spray pinkish gore across walls and ceilings. 

Tight corridors and some nice vertical touches make gunning down enemies, and avoiding their attacks, surprisingly difficult at times. The ability to perform a stylized slide can assist you in outmaneuvering enemies or quickly closing the distance for a speedy takedown. Otherwise, speed and reaction time are your only friends here. 

Maybe the only downside is a limited selection of weapons: the starting pistol, a sawn-off shotgun, an uzi, and a knife. Switching to these weapons is only available in-between levels, and are part of your three random options. This adds some RNG flavor to the mix, but can be frustrating if you have a preferred playstyle. 

[h2]Keep Moving, Keep Killing[/h2]
[Post Void] is proof that simple yet well-executed gameplay and an inspired art direction can create a masterpiece. At only $2.99, this game is an absolute steal.

0,steam_reviews/1297300_TheShore.json,1343,1,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Autumn is a season of upheaval, so the Old Gods grow ever restless. They will not fade into obscurity just like the controversial author of our current source material has found his own little patch of fame and infamy. I’m talking about Howard Phillips Lovecraft and it’s almost ironic how he died penniless and with a firm conviction that he amounted to a complete failure, only to emerge post-mortem as one of the most influential fiction writers of the 20th Century. 

Just like our buddy Franz Kafka from my previous review, Lovecraft would also inadvertently create his own literary and stylistic subgenre which has been “bleeding” quite profusely into gaming as well. The Shore marks Ares Dragonis’ Steam debut, case in point that you don’t need to have previous titles under your belt in order to leave a positive impression. Originality still shines within an abyss of reboots, remakes and remasters!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2411158389

[h1]Story [/h1]
Not going to dwell a lot on the narrative since its initial ambiguity holds few secrets: main character is a fisherman called Andrew and he’s searching for his missing daughter along the shorelines of what appears to be volcanic island, judging by the pitch black terrain. A deserted lighthouse and numerous shipwrecks confirm that the place is deserted, yet you’re not alone. Like a slow descent into madness, things and thoughts change their shapes the more you push on seeking answers and closure. What starts as a seemingly benign walking simulator, eventually shifts towards survival horror with a few puzzle sections thrown in for good measure. 

The pacing is on point, you feel compelled to explore since The Shore does an excellent job at offering the needed incentives in the form of Lovecraft references and collectibles scattered off the beaten paths. Linearity is less of an issue if you provided the necessary illusions of alternative choices. It helps that the developer made full use of the source material mythos. From Outer Gods, to Deep Ones and of course infamous Great Old Ones such as Cthulhu himself. Once you start questioning the perceived reality, you know you’ve gone too far to turn back. All roads will lead towards a rather ambiguous conclusion that leaves plenty of room for a sequel or interpretation at the very least.

[h1]Graphics[/h1] 
The Shore is powered by the Unreal Engine 4 in a very stable manner, leaving me no cause for complaint. I applaud the decision to remove any potential HUD elements, they would have only eroded the experience since I firmly believe adventure titles of any subgenre are best played without keyboard prompts or hand holding tips. You’re left to your own device from a clean first person perspective. Whether you choose to take screenshots along your journey or not, you’ve been provided with plenty of opportunities in the form of eye-catching scenery, events and creatures. It goes without saying that the environment gets increasingly surreal as the story progresses. Just as expected.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415777972

 [h1]Audio[/h1]
The sound department also received the necessary attention in the form of skilled voice acting for the narrator in equal measure to certain side characters. Soundtrack was spot on as well, never becoming repetitive or feeling out of touch with the scenes playing out before you. Almost relaxing at key points through the story but that's the literal calm before the storm, so stay alert.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
While I wouldn’t consider it a lengthy experience (you can probably finish it in under 4 hours if you’re not keen on exploration like I was), The Shore is cleverly structured in a manner that won’t allow boredom to set it. Exploration and peaceful collectible hunting is briskly interrupted by a totally different hunt in the form of chase sequences. Running for your life can only get you so far however. You will eventually gain the ability to fight back, Andrew’s own resilience growns as strong as his capabilities in time and the autosave implementation ensures that failure in combat isn’t unforgiving.

I will advise that you constantly check the inventory for new clues as well as gaining further insight into the intricacies of the Lovecraft mythos. There will be numerous objects to pick up and study in detail, from abstract sculptures to seemingly incoherent texts. Expect some puzzle sections which will require a modicum of effort, but they’re not going to strain you too much. It’s a well balanced challenge in the end, the game never felt frustratingly hard while I definitely didn’t expect a cake walk either. Come to think of it, walking sims certainly evolved a lot since the initial days of a little Half-Life 2 mod called “Dear Esther”.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415778098

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
If you’re itching to get those lovecraftian desires finally sated, look no further than The Shore. It’s the closest you’ll get to a Cthulhu love letter in 2021 minus hitting the rock bottom of controversies like a certain sinking city on Steam. It’s more than decently priced for what it offers and I can say for a fact that the title has been nurtured by its dev team constantly with updates both fixing any bugs and enhacing the gameplay with a handful of previously inaccessible areas and more Steam Achievements than it had on its release date.

0,steam_reviews/1318690_shapez.json,9646,1,"Received this as a gift after wishlisting it. I guess that qualifies as free? I didn't get it from the developer. 

This is basically Factorio without the survival and story aspect. Each ""resource"" is composed of four quadrants, which can be split and coloured and combined into literal trillions of combinations. Delivering these combined shapes to your ""hub"" earns you various upgrades to your tools, so you can deliver more shapes faster. 

There's no justification for this; you just do it to be doing it, so you can do more of it. The resources don't have any meaningful qualities other than shape and colour, and the things you make out of them have no apparent use or purpose. They're just the things you make, because you make them. Whether you regard this as some sort of pure Platonic ideal or a dystopian Kafkaesque nightmare is up to you, and the game won't push you in either direction. 

All the puzzles/strategy revolve around one fundamental process: split your resources into the components of what you're making, assemble whatever components need to be the same colour, colour those components, then assemble the coloured components into the final result and deliver it to the hub. This eventually reaches a critical mass of complexity where you have two layers of four dissimilar quadrants in four different mixed colours, and you're done. The puzzles can never get harder than that. Beyond this point, the only thing the game can do to provide ""challenge"" is to demand higher production volumes. 

Ultimately, the abstraction removes replayability. Comparison to Factorio is, of course, inevitable - while you might also compare Satisfactory or Infinifactory, Factorio is the gold standard of factory simulations. In any given game of Factorio, you have a number of goals you can pursue: you can build the rocket, you can make a fortress against the biters, you can go out hunting biters, you can build extensive railway lines, and all of these have their own particular brand of satisfaction. 

But in shapez.io you don't get any of that: just an abstract idea of production and delivery. You don't even get the benefit of choosing your path - you unlock all the same upgrades in the exact same order for the exact same production targets. There's no surprise or challenge inherent in starting a new game. You don't need to prioritise your research or choose the best starting location. You start here. Your resources are there. Your goal is this. Your reward is that. Every game starts the same. There's no point in going back to the beginning. 

Eventually, you'll converge on the most efficient multipurpose factory you can make, and as your production targets increase, you'll just duplicate it farther out. This will go on until you have every belt running into your hub filled to capacity. Assuming you don't get bored af and quit playing before that. 

For the price, however, it's good value. Plus it runs well on old hardware. And if you enjoy the puzzly parts of Factorio without enjoying the combat and survival thing so much, like I do, it might be exactly the kind of thing you've always wanted. 

But mostly it makes me want to play Factorio again.",386,english
0,steam_reviews/1343400_RuneScape.json,20819,1,"Absolutely horrible. 

I loved the game and played it a huge amount and bought a membership for 3 months for 30$ because I liked it so much. For this I was rewarded with a ban for ""macroing in oldschool"". I have literally never logged into, played, or even downloaded--let alone cheated in old school runescape where the alleged ""macroing"" happened. 

There is no way to appeal these bans, no way to speak with customer service, nothing. If they decide you did something (with no proof, again since I've literally never played the game they assert I cheated in) you are out of luck. 

If you decide to pay for membership, do it one month at a time and hope that Jagex likes you because apparently they didn't like me.

Thanks for stealing my 30$ for 5 days of membership Jagex and leaving no recourse for the mistake you made. This practice is completely disgusting.


Edit 7/27/21: Over a month later they looked into my ban and realized that it was incorrect and unbanned me. I am convinced this is because this review is the first actual review you see on the steam page that isnt a joke due to all the people who found it helpful and people who commented. I am going to leave the review up for now so people can see all the nightmares that have happened and can happen.

I will say the best takeaways from this whole thing are said in comments by tvleavitt: ""a) if you pay this company, do so directly, so that you can charge them back when their Kafkaesque non-support system screws you over; b) always, always, always enable 2FA when given the option, in this or any other game that you might possibly care about."" and SoberCoffee: ""RuneScape is easy to hack, everyone and their mother knows this. It is HIGHLY recommended by JAGEX themselves to attach an authenticator to your account before playing."" 

Keep those things in mind if you decide to play this game. Make sure to not re-use passwords with this game and anything else seeing as how easy it is to hack into accounts. Keep safe and play at your own risk my friends.

Edit 7/28/21: So I lost pretty much all my items which jagex says they can't help with so basically starting fresh with just my levels, but Jagex gave me most (but not all) of my missed membership time back so that's better than nothing I suppose. I'll say that while it's sad that it took this much to get the issue resolved, at least it mostly was. I really don't wish this experience on anyone else.",6793,english

0,steam_reviews/1369520_Strangeland.json,648,2,"Well, I did not like the game in the end. Although the game is definitely not for me, mostly because of the ideas it carries, I must say that, as far as I can tell, it took a step forward from a game design perspective. The subjective shortcomings I noticed are perfectly described in other reviews and I will not expand on them much:
[list]
[*] The convoluted presentation does not help the narrative, in my humble opinion.
[*] The character is somehow disconnected from the apparent surroundings: for a person living a nightmare he is being too distant and underreacting a lot.
[*] The character's behavior occasionally looks inadequate. Almost all adventure characters I like (April Ryan, Victoria McPherson, Azriel Odin, to name a few) are or, I would say, have to be a little cynical and humorous to naturally blurt out, ""No way I want to burn this,"" when trying to use a gas-burner on a random TV. Unfortunately, these kinds of remarks feel stilted in ""Strangeland"".
[/list]
What really ruined the experience for me, is the focus on the concept of loss and finding a way of living through with it. The developer got a bit cheesy in the in-game comments, and I would allow myself to do the same. I personally perceive loss in all its glorious irreversibility as a great monument to life's naturalness, absurdity, and also humans' transience, which does not help with understanding the character who is struggling against it for almost all of the story. This, in turn, brings me to the main pain point — the endings. Spoilers ahead. [spoiler]In the end you have an option to escape (to jump), to escape efficiently (to kill yourself), to escape inefficiently (to try fighting), and to escape by evolving (to use wings).[/spoiler]
Where is the option to do literally nothing? The authors that influenced my current self the most are Kafka, Camus, Kawabata, and, maybe, Bates, so it comes as no surprise that I ask again, ""Where is the option to do absolutely nothing? (Because the boundary between depression and melancholy is an ephemeral one, there is no significant difference between dying on your knees or fighting, because there is no significant difference among the absurdities of life in the first place.)
Do not mind me though, ""Strangeland"" is a great game overall.",237,english
0,steam_reviews/1369520_Strangeland.json,648,2,"Primordia, the previous effort by Wormwood Studios, is quite possibly my favorite ""modern"" point-and-click adventure. My expectations for Strangeland were sky-high, not just because of my affection for Primordia but because a) the artwork/aesthetics from Victor PFlug that were teased before release were obviously fantastic, and b) the writing in Primordia demonstrated unusually strong worldbuilding and structure, along with the sense of taking part of a broader discourse/tradition in literature, poetry, etc. Developer Mark Yohalem (who comes across as a cool guy and very accessible and generous with players) clearly knows his Shakespeare, Bible, Greeks, etc. Not to mention that Wadjet Eye is apparently allergic to publishing bad games.

So were expectations reached? In terms of quality I'd say yes for the most part, but with the caveat that I don't think this game will have quite as broad an appeal as Primordia did. Partly because Primordia probably just about hit the ceiling of a niche market for an old-school indie P&C adventure, but also because of the unrelenting ""inwardness"" of the game. There are a lot of games with themes about the human psyche, depression, loss, etc., but even knowing somewhat what to expect I was surprised by the abrupt opening that landed us immediately inside a mindscape with an intensely singular focus. Most players should understand pretty quickly what's generally going on, making later revelations unsurprising. To be honest, I wasn't able to invest in most of the characters in the same way as the characters in Primordia because of the understanding that they were all figments or fragments. In a certain sense, there's not really a plot- the character development and exploration of a character's psychology *is* the story, and it's plumbed at depth (but again, not with much specificity). It is quality in its presentation, but may not be to everyone's tastes in the way that post-apocalyptic robots might be.

The game also openly invites a boatload of easy comparisons to Edgar Allen Poe (to me the most striking influence), H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Kafka, H.R. Giger, the video game version of Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"" (both visually and in story tone), Greek tragedy, and likely a host of other influences I'm unfamiliar with. You might think that this would open up the game to criticisms about lack of originality- a carnival of horrors is hardly new ground. Given how well mined some of these themes have been, however, I was surprised at how original the game feels. You get the palpable sense that the developers pored their hearts and personalities into the game, and that really goes a long way toward making the whole project work.

Finally, it should be noted how smooth and professional the game as a production. I'm loathe to even implicitly criticize my favorite old Sierra games, but the interface, difficulty, and ease of use are simply much more accessible than most of the old classics. In general the difficulty and puzzles hit the right spot I think, although I wouldn't say most puzzles stand out particularly one way or another.

TLDR- It's a well-made game that the devs clearly poured their hearts into.  It will likely have a narrower appeal than Primordia, but in my book that's perfectly fine. Those looking for a personalized psychological horror will love it.

EDIT- Playing through the endings I noticed that I misattributed the artwork to Spanos (who is responsible for the impressive job done in coding, VFX, and more) rather than Victor Pflug.  Apologies!",285,english

0,steam_reviews/1443200_Classof09.json,163,1,"Class of 09 is a one of a kind visual novel, not shocking like creepypasta with sailor moon doki doki literature club shit but more like I know what you did last summer with the coach/counselor/photgraphy teacher kafka-esque nightmare bottled up with Percocet to make the story funnier. 

Any of the lives lead will leave bodies in the wake, but whether you come out on top depends on how willing you are to be fucked with. Nicole (the main character) is a particular type of... pixel... person, any bad ending is purely for your enjoyment you sick parasocial freak. That being said, try and complete the game to get all the after credits texts that shed a little light into what some of the characters are thinking. This is a funny haha game with incredibly witty dialogue, but it's very relatable at the same time. Who didn't have a coach who got accused of pedophilia? You either did or he got fired before you became a freshman and now there's a 30% chance spawn rate during those 4 years. 

All the crazy shit kids and adults project to other people because they can't read the room are in full effect with a wide cast of stereotypes. The dubbing continues to draw out quality performances, partially because the dialogue is natural, but the talent and direction weighs in too. I can only imagine the inspiration that made all of the interactions sometimes painfully real.

In conclusion, this game is everything SBN3 has poured into all his previous projects. Mean spirited truths coated in 2000's nostalgia, just like when I was growing up. There's not many other people who can capture that culture of consumerism, racism, sexism, aguilerism, stemming from an internet changed world. God I miss those days.

0,steam_reviews/1449920_GRUNND.json,28,2,"We’ve all been there. Waking up at an unknown train station in the early hours of the morning (or evening), not knowing exactly where you came from, or even if you’re still asleep. 

Okay, not really, but there’s a dreamy quality to GRUNND that draws from the Eastern European surreal and absurd literary movements, and having finished the game, I’m not sure I’ve woken up yet. 

GRUNND is a short PC point and click mystery game with science fiction elements. And while Kafkaesque is an overused description for anything bordering on the inexplicable, GRUNND is most definitely a game for Kafka fans. 

GRUNND’s story follows an unnamed Hero who wakes up on a train station in a place he’s never seen before. He struggles to get answers from any of the bizarre characters that inhabit this desolate purgatory. All he wants is a place to rest his head, but it seems that’s too much to ask. 

It’s beneficial to think of the game as an interactive story or audiobook. Quests revolve around dialogue with the strange inhabitants of Bytown, although there is one particularly challenging gateway puzzle that took me a while to figure out. You’ll find yourself talking to small children, then to strange creatures trapped in a wall, then to disaffected bar staff. You’ll probably want to take the whiskey as it’s offered. 

Mr Cleese was my favourite exchange of dialogue, which drew most heavily on the absurd literary (and comedic) movements. I wished some exchanges had been pushed further for humour or horror, but they certainly left me with the uneasiness of the game’s world. 

As a writer, one thing I admire about GRUNND is how invisible the branching narrative is. Because of the unexpected nature of the story, there are no flags which say, “You are making a choice, make sure it’s the right one.” I appreciate that - too often as gamers we’re induced to making ethical judgements in games, and punished for exploring choice. Here, you’re not sure if you’re solving a problem or creating new ones. 

There is a lot of reflective walking through this beautifully hand-drawn world. The painterly artwork is one highlight of the game. The narrator’s voice acting keeps you company through these long stretches, although his melancholic voice offers little comfort. Some gamers might struggle with the pacing here; I found myself more engaged as the story went on, but as I enjoy experimental narratives, I was willing to give GRUNND the benefit of the doubt. 

There are things that will be left unexplained well after you finish the game. I wanted to know more about the science fiction elements; the towers that reference Norse mythology, the creepy trash collectors, or even figuring out the purpose of the Farm. I’m not sure whether you got more of an explanation depending on the choices you make in the story, but clearly I made some interesting life choices! 

While GRUNND’s ending is signposted by the characters, the game ends abruptly with narration over the title screen. This could be improved by adding some extra animation or graphics appropriate to each ending, then running a credits sequence, rather than returning the player to the load screen. Without exploring other choices (see note on Save Games below), I’m unable to say whether different endings have more extended conclusions. 

While GRUNND’s narrative intrigued me, there are several issues with the gameplay that stymied my experience as a player. But they’re very fixable, and if they’re fixed, it would significantly improve the quality of gameplay. Given the game was produced by a tiny team, mostly by a single person, my intention is that this feedback would be useful, rather than highly critical. 

For me, the UX is the biggest issue in fully engaging with the game. Despite the addition of bubbles to show interactive elements, when I right-clicked on these, sometimes nothing happened. In parts, I had to click around the area a bit to get the interaction working. Sometimes the bubbles remained even after a dialogue tree had been exhausted and there was nothing more to say. 

One of the most frustrating points was trying to get out of a boat - the leave boat button was moving with my boat and would then disappear when the boat stopped at the dock. A lot of frantic clicking got me out, but this could be fixed with a bigger button that remains on screen when the boat stops. 

A few other issues: 

- The timing between dialogue choices and the character’s reaction was a little slow.
- The dialogue screen didn’t always scroll down to where I was at in the dialogue.
- There are also a couple of typos in the inventory items - easily fixed in a patch.
- I also noted that the developer is adding a Save Game function, which would really help those of us who like to explore choices in games (especially at the end)!

With a little more funding, I would also look at using a readable font in the dialogue boxes that matches the style of the game (perhaps a serif rather than what I think is Arial). Additional animation on Bytown’s strange characters would also add to the player experience. 

I felt uneasy as I left GRUNND, and that’s no bad thing. The game achieves its vision of surrealism, in an akimbo, off-kilter world that will leave you wondering what just happened.

For gamers who demand certainty, GRUNND is not for you. For those of us who dig the weird and inexplicable, GRUNND is a short, surreal experience that’s worth exploring for the seamless way it integrates branching narrative. And with a few technical tweaks, it could become an even better game.

I received a free review copy of this product from https://keymailer.co. As an independent reviewer, this does not influence my opinion of the game.",227,english

Niestety to impresja bardzo przewidywalna. Od początku wiadomo o co tu chodzi i nie ma tu żadnej tajemnicy. Memoir czerpie pomysły z masy innych udanych gier, ale nie robi z tego wystarczająco dobrze. A do tego jest bardzo nierówna i ma rozgrywkę trwającą jedynie 60 minut.

Plusy: 

+ ładne rybki
+ niezłe efekty wody
+ nawet ładna grafika 2D
+ łatwe i szybkie achievementy 

Minusy:

- jest przewidywalna (brak ciekawej fabuły, która chwyta za serce)
- nudny gejmplej (klikamy tylko LPM i przeciągamy elementy)
- niekonsekwentna strona wizualna (miks anime 2D z grafiką 3D bez możliwości poruszania)
- przeciętna do bólu muzyka i piosenki stylizowane na Life is Strange (ale znacznie gorsze)
- drętwe animacje postaci (i ten jej jednostajny skrzywdzony wyraz twarzy przez całą grę) 
- zagadki niezbyt inspirujące (mające wydłużać grę i symulować gejmplej, którego nie ma) 
- krótki czas gry (tylko 1 godzina)
- raczej bezemocjonalny finał

0,steam_reviews/1578650_CitizenSleeper.json,3525,1,"I think it's the most beautiful and sentimental game from Garret. I heard his interviews and what he used as inspiration for this game and it's truly a metaphor for the dificult and excruciating everyday life. I often find myself thinking about the Kafkaeske representation of this game. I think it's the same message from my favourite book from Kafka, The Castle, which is a tale of bureaucratic paralysis, invisible barriers and a labyrinth of obstacles that splinter into more obstacles. Like The Castle, this game unnerves with its depiction of a pointless, frustrating existence. Garret takes you away from your life  with all its stress and secret desolations, only to return you, shattered, to a new reality in which you must confront those truths you'd rather forget, like work, socialize, live. Garret destabilises us by writing about the familiar, the banality of daily existence, but disguising it so it appears to us a strange dream or science fiction.",271,brazilian

You need to play this game, period. 

Horror is a though nut to crack, the things you found scary now may be laughable eventually, and as time progress and all facets of culture become more mainstreamed in order to make more bank, most entertainment industry relly on cheap jump scares rather than actual horror. This is why I´ve always felt more attracted to existencial horror, not the scare itself or a shocking creature running on a hallway, but the dreadfulness of loneliness, the suspense of guilt or the horrors of understanding there´s no god, just a ball of mud in the void floting towards irrelevance on a cosmic level.

If On a Winter´s Night, Four Travelers luckily falls more into the existencial horror type, with a Dantesque approach to it´s characters and stories, where we are presented with the usual ""unkown character share among themselves their own stories on a weiry and unkown setting"" which has become a cliche on it´s own but one that works really well and doesn´t see much use in this century´s narrative arts. Authors like H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, Kafka or Mary Shelley will come out of the periphery of your subconscious while playing the three characters (the fourth isn´t playable and mostly works as the final plot twist) in this set piece taking place in early 20th century.

Besides the fantastic story and writting, I cannot let pass the oportunity to mention as well how gorgeous this game looks, with a mixture of isometric perspectives and pixel art it finds a perfect tone for the stories it tells while looking astonishing in every single frame, each new area visited is a feast of class and design that deserves to be appreciated on it´s own and it´s not rare for me to simply not click anything and just contemplate the scenes. And the music, it would be impossible to give enough credit to how well excecuted and set the musical compositions in the game and how they are integrated in the scene. And it´s not just the music, every single sound cue has relevance, weight, and a real impact on the player.

However not everything is gold, in the fairness of critique I must point out that the acts feel a little disjointed, while 2 and 3 are fantastic on it´s setting and execution presenting their characters and their inner worlds as well the traumas that let them to that position, 1 is the one that has the more to say about society of that period but at the same time the more realistic and short and therefor it makes less of an impact overall. The character certainly makes an impact on the end and there´s real commentary on his story, but the other two just feelt more intimate and we trully see the world through the eyes of the character in a way act 1 does not. All of them could work as movies on themselves, but perhaps the sadness of act2 and the weirdness of act3 are far more impressive, really makes you wish act1 had a similar presentation and that there were more acts. And quite frankly beyond act1 being a little soft in comparison to me the worst part is act4, you know what the twist is gona be, and it´s that... short of, presented via some short of comedic duet between the fourth passenger and a new character it removes all mystery and the tone of the game seems to switch a little bit only to provide a little bit of hope of the end of the shitstorm... it feels a little tackle and cheap for me personally, but that may be a personal taste thing. 

Overall like I said in the TL;DR at the beggining, I do belive this is one of the best free games on steam, and if this the level of quality and commitment to a style we can expect from this developers, this is a promise to a future collection of amazing games.

Forever To You is a slightly confused game. Not in its mechanics, which are easy to grasp, but in trying to find its identity as a game. Basically, just imagine the main character is Franz Kafka, but he's overdosed on Viagra. (This is now the strangest sentence I have ever written in a game review, and by a large margin.)

On the surface, it's just a very simplistic “play cards to get sex and nudity as a reward” game – something very run of the mill and pretty common in the adult gaming space. It has a typically ludicrous premise – a naughty harlequin appears and gives you a magical deck of playing cards, and then proceeds to teach you how to use them to seduce women.

What follows is not the hilarious sex romp and pseudo-harem game that I anticipated, however. Instead, the main character monologues at great length about whether or not this is what he wants, and if it makes him happy. The game is divided up into chapters that follow your encounters with several different women, and at points the tone ends up being a very heavy one, touching on desire, forbidden attraction, unhappiness in relationships, and at points, the human condition itself. It's unexpected, and unfortunately, I'm not sure that it really works here.

Part of the issue is with the translation – the dev is clearly trying to explain some complex thoughts and philosophies at points (though sometimes those thoughts really are just “I really want to have intercourse with this woman”, in fairness), and whatever translation program or service he used is just not up to the task. It leads to stilted and confusing dialogue a lot, and sometimes it's bad enough that I was unable to even understand what they meant to say. (Though context usually at least provided a general idea.) It's really a shame, because I feel like the writer had a lot to say, and really wanted to explore some more complex themes than the genre normally allows. All that aside, however, I'm not sure that this particular subgenre is necessarily the place where that sort of stuff is going to hit its mark with the audience, even with perfect translation.

Mechanically, the game is sound enough – the card game is simple to learn (though it never explains how to discard a card from your hand, which led to some trial and error on my part), and generally not very nuanced or tricky. The sex scenes have a very simplistic “click the hot spot” style minigame attached,  and there's also a memory game to unlock CG's. The latter two are easy enough that you could sleepwalk through, while the first requires some thought, but not a ton. That's not a complaint-most of us would rather not have to try too hard to complete a game like this, and the added gameplay sections do add some value. 

The CG's are fairly high quality, while the sex scenes have simplistic animation and art of average to above average quality. It's nothing revolutionary, but at a price point of $5 USD, it's pretty hard to complain. I feel good giving this a recommend, but be aware that it's not the happy-go-lucky style adult game you're probably used to, tone-wise.

The demo hooked me, but the actual game featured several ""have to reload"" bugs, and one game-breaking bug (customers come in two types, product, and consumer; product customers are harvested for resources you need to satisfy consumer customers, and I experienced a complete stoppage on just product customers). I ""solved"" this by upgrading everything except the greenhouse (unlocked by purchasing tomatoes), until I was forced to buy the greenhouse to progress the campaign.

For a very small production team and a $2-3 dollar price tage, this game is worth it if you aren't turned off by a bit of squick for a few hours. The environments are grungy, but the actual processing is rather tame (you frequently find yourself looking elsewhere during longer, gorier processes just because they take quite a bit of time).

Lastly, I've noticed a lot of complaints about Endless mode, and the aggressive police presence. If you are wanting to play Endless without the police, the game allows you to continue playing after you've completed the campaign... and there's no police.

0,steam_reviews/1639790_NorthernJourney.json,1355,1,"Just completed this game and I found it to be a great experience! 
It's a fast paced FPS with a surreal narrative, full of beautiful scenery. 
The game features a ton of weapon variety and environmental challenges. Be warned, this game can be very hard but every challenge is surmountable with the correct approach. Personally I found some of the platforming segments quite coarse and touchy for how quickly the player moved and the amount of multitasking required; but these challenges were ultimately rewarding as they push you to revise your strategy and adapt to the situation. I found it useful to avoid picking up certain items in easily accessible areas if I already had enough health and ammo, allowing me to spread the limited resources over a larger amount of the game. The mechanics change often, providing new game-play variety in almost every new area while never abandoning the core experience of fps action. 

The character design is loony and inspired, dripping with symbolism. The dialogue is sometimes blunt, playfully mocking the player while providing detailed instructions. Other times it's satirical, bordering on Kafkaesque, lots of humor, and folk sensibilities.
The world is simply gorgeous. Most areas are multifaceted with great attention to detail. A layered lock and key system makes backtracking rewarding and there are plenty of useful items stuffed into the nooks and crannies. The music is at once grand and subdued, buzzing bass and cutting synthesizers are paired with eerie sounds of the forest and melodic chanting. Unfortunately the audio mastering leaves a little to be desired. Although the mix sounds great with headphones; through my speakers the music was barely audible over the sound effects and ambient noise and the only option in the settings is to reduce the music volume!
Although some players might find the level of polish unsatisfying (there are a couple dips in quality throughout the massive world map, and occasionally you can get stuck in the ground, forcing you to jump up a smooth incline), the game is clearly not made by a large team with a budget; those who appreciate a handcrafted experience will find a lot to enjoy in this game.

0,steam_reviews/1684510_ThePlaneEffectPrologue.json,144,1,"Loved it!
The feeling the prologue left me with is still here now.... I mean, in mechanical and artistic terms I could compare it to Limbo, only it's not any kind of platformer and it's isometric 3d, not 2d. Gameplay wise, (and to some extent graphically) It kind of reminds me of Little Big Adventure, with Limbo's sense of darkness and sudden stabs of savagery.. Narratively, I could compare it to The Stanley Parable, except the game has no dialogue and also in visual, world-building and tonal aspects to any number of surreal, dystopian games and tales. Beholder 2, Brave new world,  Fahrenheit 45 1, The Zero  Theorem, kafka, Erazerhead, even Bullfrog's Syndicate,..... I COULD, but it really wouldn't be fair. Though The Plane Effect definitely calls so many other things to mind, it has a warmth and heart to it that I really wasn't expecting. It also has the best snow I've ever seen in any game ever. I love the presentation, the (almost) monochrome palette, the totally absent U.I, the quiet, under-stated yet totally surreal mood, the way it tells it's tale completely visually without dialog, the nasty, unexpected little things that happen every so often and the weirdly proportioned, faceless yet lovable protagonist. Underneath it all I suppose,  it's  sort of a  of walking sim with some mild yet gratifying puzzling to be done, but again I feel it is a little unfair to boil it down to merely being this.   the game definietly has a story to tell and a very sophisticated way of telling it. Anyway, it runs very smoothly, lasts half an hour and costs nothing. It's ending Is rather abrupt, but in quite a darkly amusing way. I'd really like to play the rest of it right now, but the full game isn't out yet, So I guess that I'll have to wait. Very Promising.",36,english

There is a point when a great artist becomes an abused adjective, tossed around with such excess it becomes meaningless. After 'Kafkaesque', that honour now goes to 'Lynchian' as a shorthand for anything with even a hint of weird, surreal and bizarre, that I started to take it with a good dose of scepticism. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to discover that [b][i]Who's Lila?[/i][/b] not only earns that epithet through superficial associations like audio-visual motifs, tone and references, but by actually going deep into Lynch's core themes and ideas, and perhaps most importantly, by reflecting the way a mystery is approached, and even further, by examining the true meaning of the mystery itself.

Who's Lila? is so deeply Lynchian (and by extension Jungian) that I could fill this whole review just talking about all the ways it intersects with the Lynchverse, writing a review within a review, creating a recursive simulacrum in the process. The game understands Lynch on a fundamental level, it's not merely a tribute, but a love letter.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919342836
""Father Lawrence is dead"", a line near the beginning, an obvious homage to Lost Highway's enigmatic ""D1ck Laurent is dead"", similarly jumpstarts the dreamlike loop, a wheel of slippery time and uncertain borders and definitions, of self-reference within self-reference, the circularity of self. Meanwhile... riding this Ferris wheel of tarot cards, and ""temporary shards of coloured glass"", you will glimpse through kaleidoscopic spin loads of citations, from associative fragments*1 to substantial, powerful synchronicities. The missing girl, Tanya Kennedy, has such a strong Laura Palmer energy, almost like a doppelganger in spirit, and there's certainly no shortage of doubles and mirrors here either. There's more than one connection to Twin Peaks specifically, but nowhere more potent than in the way the main question of the mystery is posed: 

Who killed Laura Palmer?  
Who's Lila?

Alright, lemme me quickly answer it so we can get on with the more important stuff. Ready? Lila is [spoiler]""the mystery of who Lila is.""[/spoiler]
Wait, what about Laura Palmer? Watch Twin Peaks asap, all 2 of you!*2 

With that out of the way, I want to emphasise a crucial parallel. Both the game and the series are investigative fiction on the surface, the kind that would be perfect for classic adventure puzzle solving; but that's not what they are. A puzzle can be solved, whereas mystery ""can only be framed.""*3 Lila is THE self-perpetuating mystery in the purest sense, one designed to be just about solvable, to only swerve you off course later on when you're hit with sinking realisation of a whole new dimension of meaning. It's teasing of the best kind, not just there for its own sake to keep you hooked forever, to nest itself firmly as a prisoner in your skull by not giving closure for continued attention. Instead of using its crypticness as a shield from engaging with it critically, it actively invites you to play with it, to participate in a constructive, highly conceptual dialogue, one that will send your mind reeling in all directions. It once sent me on a treasure hunt (by way of ARG elements), but I veered slightly off trail and ended up spending all night reading about the hard problem of consciousness. Time well spent. 

[h3]The Garden of Forking Paths[/h3]
Speaking of ARG transmedia, without spoiling the joy of discovery, I'll just say it's tightly woven with all the meta elements which, in turn, spring seamlessly from the inner story, the wheel of dreams. The menu is a metagame, the Waking, if we see the game 'proper' as the Dreaming. There my character (Will) sleeps, and starting a new game is like waking up.*4 I think the term ""quantum fiction"" could rightfully apply here as this kind of storytelling recognises the observer, YOU, the gamer, as the active participant. But who is the Dreamer? 

""Half of the time I'm not even sure whether it's today, tomorrow, or a month ago!"" Deceptive time and uncertainty principle mirror this indeterminate terrain in total structural non-linearity and fractured continuity. The game fully embraces multiple timelines approach to weaving a story. There's no canonical path, all of them are equally real, and none of them are, all are important but ultimately ephemeral. Playing these brief routes, which are akin to short bursts of lucid dreaming, you slowly piece together the whole, puzzle by puzzle, instance by instance, dream by dream, you long to grasp the full picture, but never quite get there. The mosaic pieces do not outright smoothly blend, you can still make out the tesserae, especially the missing ones.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933159586

This is a mystery in a metaphysical sense. It feeds off your curiosity, the need to understand every detail, perfect the story, get closure. Like a dream, its structure is loose, but not random, and no matter how blurring the effect, how abstracted it becomes down to the very particles, or rather pixels of this lovely dither-punk style, there's inner logic underneath it all, a unified field of consciousness, providing multilayered fluidity.*5

The mystery is eternal, because how can you solve the enigma of the mind. That's essentially what the game is about; beneath the surface-level detective adventure, there's a personal story made universal, or rather the consciousness of the universe is used to tell an individual story. Who's Lila? is ultimately about the nature of identity; about the fiction of personality and the phantom of the impermanent, always-changing self.*6

[h3]""That's normal for a human... Isn't it?""[/h3]
""The self is by its essence a divide."" Emphasised by the permanent split screen, this disconnect from the wholeness, being specified, plucked out of the collective unconscious slumber, aka alienated, is nowhere more efficaciously conveyed than on William's neutral nothing face. Our MC struggles with nonverbal communication, namely expressing emotions through facial movement. Imagine if you had to consciously decide on every miniscule muscle twitch and rehearse it in front of a mirror as a part of morning routine. (No, I'm in touch with humanity.) The main gameplay mechanic, a facial-expression-based choice system, is not merely a gimmick; this playing sculptor with someone else's face is also decisively enacted thematically. There's an implied dissociation between an outward expression and the inner self; identity as a projection, persona as a mask we put on, a performance. It's easy to read low/no empathy in Will.*7 Every time you wake him up (start a game) when he slowly, but also kind of abruptly, opens his cold eyes, directs his vacant gaze at you... an uncomfortable awareness takes root: there's nobody home. The end of the film reel. Or the start of one; there's a fraction of time missing before the mask of sanity is firmly in place, letting you gaze into the void unhindered. Although changing Will's expressions from screen to screen always has this off-kilter, uncanny quality, not to mention full-on freaky, going back to the baseline of neutral nothingness is the most unsettling sight.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2914680065
The game sheds a spotlight on this performative artificiality and reveals discomfort when looking at people's faces from a disturbingly small distance. Will's is always there right in front of your own, magnifying the tension between the fictional and real, acting and being, the film reel that plays itself and light that projects it. ""That's normal for a human... Isn't it?""

0,steam_reviews/17410_MirrorsEdge.json,33989,1,"Mirror's Edge is a flawed game, but I don't think you can have a complete picture of games as an art form without experiencing it. It's described as a ""first-person action-adventure"", which is code for ""you run around a lot and sometimes get into fights"". Broadly there are two modes of gameplay, platforming and combat.

[h2]Platforming[/h2]
First person platforming is in general not great, but Mirror's Edge actually does pretty well here! This was the game that popularized wall-running, but there's a sizeable set of other traversal mechanics - swinging on bars, rolling to break falls, and so on. It's not a super complex system, but it's a fun one and it's got enough depth to keep the levels engaging.

The parkour traversal is the heart of the game, and it's good enough that I still come back to it every few years to play again. Even if there were no story or action sequences, it'd still be worth getting and playing. There are a few low points where things are just frustrating with unclear visual cues, difficulty spikes in jumps you have to make, and so on. The game doesn't quite always know if it wants the traversal itself to be challenging, or the route planning to be challenging, or both, or neither. In the game's defense, however, it was in many ways the first of its kind, and I don't think there was a very well set understanding of what a game like this should be - and, by and large, they do get it right.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
Mirror's Edge gives you a pretty simple set of movement based kicks and punches. You can slide-kick into guards to knock them over, land on them, and perform running takedowns. Given that the conceit behind the *majority* of the game is to run, not fight, that works; you're not really invested in truly defeating or killing the faceless security goons who stand in your way, just in buying enough time for yourself to progress without getting shot.

. . .Except for the parts of the game where it decides that's not the case. Mirror's Edge has bossfights. They're not amazing, and it's not a great fit for the game. It also has mandatory combat sections where you cannot progress without knocking out or killing every guard in an area. These sections [i]suck[/i]. There are three reasons for this.

[list]
  [*] The punch-kick combat system doesn't have sufficient depth. You just don't have the tools to solve all the combat in the game in a reasonable way that feels good. You *can* beat all the game's content with just punches and kicks and running, but you'll have to work around or break the system, not operate within it.
  [*] . . .Or, you could steal the security guards' guns and shoot them. The gunplay feels bad by design, because this isn't a shooter and it doesn't fit the character, but also the game is balanced around it and there are a couple areas in particular that are near-unbeatable without grabbing a gun and mercing people (the parking garage and the server room - you'll know them when you get there). This is a baffling, stupid design choice. It doesn't fit the setting or the character or the gameplay or the tone of the game, and I think it's a vestige of an older concept that didn't get polished out. I hate it and wish it wasn't in the game at all.
  [*] Mirror's Edge is, at its heart, a parkour game. Faith is a runner. Her successes should be (and mostly are) about outrunning, outmaneuvering, and outsmarting her opponents, not beating them to a pulp. Knocking someone out of the way or sweeping their legs to get by them is one thing, slavishly dueling each and every guard in a room is another. These sections are a coffee stain on the game, and a sign of meekness - the developers weren't brave enough to make a game that didn't have mandatory combat, even though they knew they were designing something where that wouldn't make sense.
[/list]

So aside from pretty good (but occasionally frustrating) platforming and mediocre (and sometimes awful) combat, what does Mirror's Edge have going for it?

[h2]""Aesthetic""[/h2]
You can decide for yourself if you enjoy the overall tone of the game, but the design itself is really consistent, really well done, and really fresh - it was unique in 2009, and not many games have replicated it since.

Mirror's Edge isn't the only media to explore the concept of a ""dystopia that brands itself as a utopia"", but it does it with a rare nuance and deftness. Everything in the city is clean and safe and secure. The rooftops are spotless white, access tunnels and maintenance pathways are well-lit and organized, and even construction sites look like Ikea showrooms. What's great about it is that this isn't a facade. It's not fake-clean, it's actual clean. It's not fake-secure, it's actual secure. The city isn't a *lie* - in some ways, it [i]is[/i] a utopia. It's just one with a cost, is all.

The thesis of Mirror's Edge is that people need some messiness. There needs to be some violence, some rebellion, some risk, and some freedom in order to truly have the full human experience. Not everything should have fences and guardrails and watchdogs and surveillance - both mechanically and thematically, sometimes you [i]should[/i] be able to jump off a roof to get to another building. It's not a rejection of the core concepts of safety and tidiness, it's a rejection of the thoughtless, universal application of those to every part of life.

That's interesting! Not a lot of stories manage to capture that nuance, and a big part of what makes it work for Mirror's Edge is how baked into the visuals and gameplay it is. You aren't told things are controlled and secure and micro-managed, you see it. There's not audio logs about Kafkaesque corporate management or the drudgery of daily life in the city, there's the oppressive reality of experiencing the environments and trying to move and navigate around them (this is something the sequel gets really wrong, as it happens).

[h2]Faith[/h2]
I'm gonna go ahead and say Faith is one of the best protagonists in video games. This is largely because of how little they try to do with her, and how they instead let her be defined by the *actions* she takes in the story. She isn't an ideologue, she isn't a dummy, and she isn't a mary sue - she has her takes on how the world works and what makes people tick, she has her skills and talents that she uses, and she has her own motivations, which are all represented through the choices she makes, rather than through speeches she gives. She's a reflection of the game's themes, and the gameplay is in-turn (mostly) a reflection of her (this is also why the gunplay is such a braindead choice).

I won't harp on this too long, because she isn't a particularly [i]deep[/i] character, but I wanted to call it out because she doesn't cleanly fit an archetype. She feels human and real and I can't think of many other characters I can really say that about. Again, this is something the sequel very thoroughly failed to understand, and I think it's a big part of why you don't see the same love for Catalyst that you do for this game.

    The elements in which the whole thing is presented alternate between Kafkaesque & Lovecraftian.
    One of the most positive aspects of this story is the dense, oppressive atmosphere, which is underlined very well by the reduced color palette & the sound design, as well as the electronic or rock music.
    The only major point of criticism is the not very sophisticated turn-based combat system.

As porn: 10\10. Don't need any patches, game full and uncensored in this steam release. Great voice acting, good scenes. I can describe main genre as ""hentai horror"". Not a ""hentai with horror"", but exactly ""hentai horror""(If you gonna read this you will probably get what I mean), and this is really unusual expirience which I liked. Also I was affraid that there gonna be a lot of scenes with tentacles, but most of h-scenes fortunately with humans.

As story: 7.5\10(for long route). This is still pretty unique work, with overwhelming depressive atmosphere that well-made and makes you feel really immersive in it, but soon you will have feeling like you are reading some porn version of Kafka. Well, this have to be expected from dark close-to-nukige work about raping magical girls, but I'm personally don't like when plot go like this. Sometimes the plot became very stupid even within the rules of it's own universe, like excuse just to have some more sex scenes, which was the reason why I don't like the short route.

0,steam_reviews/1850570_DEATHSTRANDINGDIRECTORSCUT.json,17603,1,"Premier jeu post Metal Gear pour Hideo Kojima et son studio, DS est sorti en faisant un sacré boucan car il était à la fois plein de belles promesses et cryptique dans sa présentation.
Je le recommande chaudement mais je vous conseille surtout de vous aventurer dans la reconstruction des UCA en connaissance de cause. 

[h1]Contexte, Fedex et Odradek[/h1]
Pourquoi faut-il s’attaquer à Death Stranding “en connaissance de cause” ? Parce que c’est un jeu plutôt difficile à appréhender. Il y est question d’explorer différents principes philosophiques et scientifiques un peu pointus et si vous n’êtes pas familiers avec l’univers de Kafka, les théories d’extinction de masse et de nombreuses autres références, DS peut-être une porte d’entrée vers de nouveaux horizons culturels et intellectuels.
Si tout ça peut sembler pompeux, croyez-moi quand je vous assure que la familiarité avec ces références vous aidera à saisir les parties les plus subtiles du très bon scénario de DS en plus de vous pousser vers des interrogations nouvelles.

Pour vous la faire courte, après un cataclysme nommé Death Stranding, le monde des morts s’est retrouvé entremêlé avec celui des vivants et a conduit l’humanité (enfin, les Etats-Unis puisque c’est ici que tout prend place) vers une ère post-apocalyptique dans laquelle l’état n’existe plus, les communications et les déplacements sont devenus compliqués et la survie de l’espèce humaine incertaine.
Mandaté par la société Bridges, Sam est un livreur chargé de rallier le pays d’Est en Ouest pour bâtir le réseau chiral afin de rassembler les habitants des UCA (United Cities of America), il devra effectuer de nombreuses livraisons en vue de créer du lien entre les différents abris de survivants et leur rendre la volonté de vivre en société.
Mais cette tâche ingrate, motivée par l’espoir de sauver une personne qui lui est chère, sera entravée par des conditions climatiques et géologiques terribles, des terroristes désireux de semer le chaos ainsi que ce fameux monde des morts qui s’approche si près de celui des vivants qu’il le ruine petit à petit et l’emplit de créatures aussi dangereuse qu’effrayantes.

Voilà pour le contexte. Le scénario de Death Stranding est d’une finesse exemplaire et mérite qu’on pousse l’aventure jusqu’à son terme. On pourra buter sur la question du gameplay axé sur la pénibilité de cette tâche qu’on ressent également en tant que joueur ; en effet, si Sam en prend plein la tronche, vos nerfs à vous seront également mis à rude épreuve. Les livraisons sont délicates et les différents obstacles qui parsèment le parcours de Sam vous feront perdre l’équilibre ainsi que votre cargaison et vous rendront la tâche de plus en plus difficile, factuellement et psychologiquement.

Alors parlons de ce gameplay qui est certainement le point de scission le plus évident de ce jeu. L’idée de l’avoir rendu fastidieux pour renforcer l’identification entre Sam et le joueur peut sembler hasardeuse mais à mon avis, elle prend tout son sens quand DS est abordé sous l’angle de “strand game” dont Kojima se vante beaucoup. Car si le jeu peut sembler injuste, pénible et lourdingue (je veux dire, c’est des quêtes Fedex en terrain hostile hein), c’est précisément dans l’objectif de vous faire apprécier l’idée du “strand”. Cette fonctionnalité vous permet de partager des structures, des indications et des améliorations placées par chaque joueur sur la carte. Admettons que je bâtisse un pont pour franchir un fleuve, il apparaîtra dans la partie des autres joueurs une fois qu’ils auront raccordé la région où il se situe dans leur propre réseau chiral.
En fait, c’est là que l’astuce est brillante ; Death Stranding est un jeu usant à parcourir, mais tous les joueurs sont dans la même galère. Et cette dimension d’entraide prend tout son sens puisqu’on en tire pour seule récompense des likes qui n’ont pas d’utilité concrète. Tout ce qu’il y a, c’est de la solidarité face à des situations difficiles que nous partageons.

[h1]Kojima : Un visionnaire à la ramasse ?[/h1]
Alors cette notion de “strand game”, elle est chouette, mais elle s’inscrit surtout dans la tradition de Hideo Kojima et son complexe de visionnaire. L’est-il vraiment ?
Il y a de la place pour un débat.
Si on revient un peu sur la carrière du bonhomme, on peut se souvenir de MGS qui a effectivement anticipé plusieurs choses devenues relativement concrètes avec le temps ; les thérapies génétiques appliquées aux militaires, la guerre de l’information ainsi que l’économie de la guerre qui ravagerait certaines régions du globe au profits de pays plus puissants.
Il n’y pas à dire, Kojima a le nez creux à ce niveau et il ne l’a jamais autant eu qu’avec Death Stranding qui est sorti en novembre 2019, six mois avant que le monde entier ne soit plongé dans une pandémie qui nous a toutes et tous forcés à nous réfugier chez nous.
Par ailleurs, ces fameux likes qui prennent une place importante dans l’univers de Death Stranding ont pour vocation à nous poser la question de notre rapport aux réseaux sociaux et de notre dépendance à l'ocytocine générée par ces derniers… 

Cependant, malgré tous ces éléments qui pourraient nous faire dire que Kojima est effectivement un peu visionnaire, le jeu en lui-même dessert ce propos. Commençons par la technique qui est meilleure que sur PS4 mais toujours insuffisante puisque Death Stranding accuse de nombreux bugs de collision (en particulier avec les véhicules), d’un système de combat et de tir datés et sans saveur (bien qu’encore une fois, ce soit moins maladroit que dans le jeu d’origine).
Et puis, il faut mentionner le point commun le plus marquant entre MGS V et DS ; le rythme du jeu pose un souci dans la narration des deux titres. Si le début des est impeccable, bien équilibré entre narration et phases de gameplay, les dix heures suivantes font office de remplissage avant des fins haletantes et intelligentes. Dans le cas de MGS V, on avait pu lui laisser le bénéfice du doute, compte tenu d’un développement chaotique et de relations difficiles avec Konami. Mais cette nouvelle itération des mêmes problématiques témoigne de l’état de fait suivant : Hideo Kojima ne parvient pas à scénariser efficacement ses jeux en open-world alors que le concept est désormais maîtrisé par la majorité de l’industrie.

Et c’est affreusement dommage parce que DS est un jeu terriblement audacieux, porté par de vrais acteurs (le casting est d’ailleurs somptueux), une ambition cinématographique qui donne des séquences exceptionnelles, une bande-son, des visuels, une ambiance et une direction artistique qui laissent pantois… 

[h1]Et si on a déjà joué à la version de base ?[/h1]
Pour la faire archi-courte, la Director’s Cut est une expérience très différente malgré qu’on soit familier avec le jeu parce que le framerate est enfin digne de ce nom, que l’IA des ennemis a été revue au point qu’ils représentent enfin un danger et que certains points du scénario sont éclaircis dans cette upgrade.
Puis on notera quelques sympathiques qualities of life bienvenues et petits bonus qui font référence à divers jeux de l’univers de Valve, à Cyberpunk, etc…

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Je pense en avoir assez dit pour que vous ayez une vision honnête de ce jeu aussi clivant qu’étonnant.
DS est imparfait mais il est puissamment poétique et résolument brillant.
Je recommande ce jeu pour deux raisons ; d’abord parce qu’il est question ici d’une prise de risque qui nous a fourni un jeu comme on n'en avait encore jamais vu, quelque chose de neuf et de rare. Malgré ses défauts, j’estime qu’il vaut le coup d’être parcouru.
Deuxièmement, parce que DS2 est en développement, qu’il s’annonce tout aussi brillant et que se familiariser avec le concept et l’univers de ce jeu ne peut que vous pousser à vous intéresser à sa suite.

Dans tous les cas, le futur ne dépend que de vous et de votre capacité à entrer en connexion avec le monde qui vous entoure. Et ça peut commencer par un jeu vidéo.",5079,french

Mixing survival grinding and non-linear storytelling, you can truly make a difference in this Lovecraftian horror story.

At the same time, it proves that you can take a short story and build a whole interesting game around it.

Most stories by H.P. Lovecraft are reminiscent of Kafka's writings, in that there is no way to resist the strange forces pushing against the protagonist, ending in physical death, total loss of sanity or worse.

However, in this game you can actually make the ending 100% positive for Walter and the good-natured inhabitants of Arkham. There is not just one character and plot, but many threads that need to be explored and possibly resolved.

Part of the fun is getting to know this new kind of game, but the storytelling, the graphics and sounds are all superb, really drawing you into this strange world revolving around the happenings in an early 20th century New England town.

Random events and little shufflings of MacGuffins stir things up a little, but what makes for the big differences in playthroughs are your decisions throughout the game. What stats and actions you focus upon every day determines how Walter is going to handle certain events. At other times, you simply have to let the plot do its thing, as locations and what you can do around them change.

As another reviewer has remarked, you'll probaby spend the first couple weeks of your first attempt at the game mostly bumbling around, trying to get a grasp how it all works and around the things that are happening throughout the story.

In summary, I highly recommend trying this game, but be careful: it's addictive in an Anno sort of way (""just one more thing..."").

0,steam_reviews/1946430_GarageBadDreamAdventure.json,150,2,"As much as I like the Gigeresque bodies and the Kafkaesque world, the gameplay is a disaster, unfit for many of the keywords boasted by the sales pitch.

One keyword that matches is Survival, hammered by no less than 2 gauges, when 1 is enough to make any game a chore.
These are not timers; they go down with every single move you make, which is not better.
Such a design achieves 2 things only: For the player, it punishes exploration and backtracking, when a good game should promote the former and work hard to make the latter unnecessary. For the publisher. it makes their game longer to finish. Nothing more.
Is backtracking made unnecessary ? On the contrary. With the Save feature crippled, limited to 1 location, you must crawl back to your room any time you want to record your progress.

Every move empties both gauges.
Fast.
When one of them reaches down a certain threshold, you can speak no more. No progress possible, and no more storytelling. Charming...
When the other one is low enough, you can't perform physical actions; you can only move.
Consequently,  you go to a refill station regularly. One for each gauge. In different spots. Because of course.
To reach a station, you spend fluids, your gauges go down.

Needless to say, Exploration is dead. Anyone can see that by glancing briefly at the design paper.
Could be worse though, they could make you pay for the gauge refills.
So they do.
They make you pay with a depletable resource.
Which brings us to the core gameplay...

The fishing mini-game.
A rudimentary arcade thingy that could get a thumb up as a free, web page-embedded time killer.
You must go to a fishing spot and play the mini-game to get loot, then go to another spot to sell the loot to get currency, then go and spend the currency to refill the fluids that allow you to fish, to talk to merchants, and simply to move to said spots.
If that was tedious to read, imagine how tedious it is to actually play it.
Could be worse though, they could make the mini-game require extra depletable resources.
So they did. Hooks, baits...

If any gauge reaches zero, you die.
Then you respawn in your room, with just enough fluids to reach the refill stations.
Not because forced backtracking every 5 minutes wasn't punishing enough, no: it's the dev's solution to avoid softlocks.
When you need pesetas to get fluids, and fluids to get pesetas, softlocks are right around the corner.
A better and simpler design would let you at least move and fish with depleted gauges, but it wasn't to be.

Here you have it, the glorious game loop: constant backtracking between a few fixed spots, micro-management of every step, and fishing as a must to keep that cycle running.
Where are the Adventure, the Point n' Click, the Immersive Sim, you ask ?
Not here, that's where,
 I've read nothing unrelated to the meta-gaming, seen only dead-ends, insta-deaths, collectibles... one possible puzzle but not a single clue yet.
Sure, there is an objective, a direction. Sure, by micro-managing your steps, you'll reach a spot out of the Ouroboros, on occasion. Even get some NPC monologue.
You could disregard the gauges, try and die until you build an optimal path, then use it as the path you choose to save.
It's still tedium though.
Extreme tedium.

The way I see it, this game is ultra-niche.
It can only appeal to the masochists, and to the virtual fishing junkies.
Got to admit, the fish (or frog, or bait) variety is there. Seems to have received as much love as the rest of the world building (that's a compliment.)

[h3]Technical Issues and Performance[/h3]
While the game crashed once in the main menu, I have not otherwise encountered bugs or issues. That being said, the game does have a tendency to have rather lengthy loading times and to be a bit unresponsive to your mouse. The latter is solely the case during combat, as you drag a chain from the left of your screen to the right. This is a visualization of the game's combat system, but in actuality, it feels more like it is merely hamstrung by the need to cater to mobile devices.

[h3]Graphics and Sound[/h3]
Graphically, Limbus Company is almost a straight upgrade from Library of Ruina. Despite being a mobile game, characters are in general more detailed, and there is a respectable variety in the new combat animations. Due to the game, unlike other gacha, only featuring a limited cast of characters, their artwork and skins are also more glamorous than some genre competitors. Many story sequences carry over the trend of featuring CG, which, unlike LoR, seems to switch art styles occasionally and thus may feel jarring during certain moments in the story. 

The sound design is once again one of the highlights. Especially Mili’s tracks that accompany the ends of the different chapters with their lyrics tying back into the plot; dialogue is delivered confidently, albeit once again only with a Korean voiceover; and combat at large feels more impactful than before due to what feels like a big increase in the feedback of weapons hitting your opponents. 

[h3]Gameplay and Gacha Design[/h3]
While LC improved, or at least maintained, the quality of LoR in terms of its presentation, the game grinds up a lot against the restrictions that a gacha title brings with it. The core gameplay is still the same: You have control over one to six characters, the sixth being limited to a guest character from your friends, and have a selection of two abilities per round that replace the deckbuilding aspect from before. 

Effectively, this means that each character still comes with a ""deck"" of abilities, but the player has lost the ability to customize it in favor of needing to roll for an entire skillset through the gacha system. In addition to the abilities’ effects and damage type, skills are now also associated with a sin and effectively tie into a rather loose combo system that simply rewards picking skills of a similar category multiple times per turn. This feels annoying at the best of times, due to both the sheer lack of tactical decisions to be made per turn as well as the clunky U.I. disallowing you from just reading each ability before selecting them strictly in order as they will fire during actual combat. 

While both Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina featured fairly infamous difficulty curves, Limbus Company is remarkably generous, and even with your baseline characters, you will have little trouble clearing the current chapters. The focus here seems to clearly be providing a story-focused experience rather than the slow but rewarding gacha progression, which makes me question who this game is supposed to be for, as mechanically it merely is a thinned out Library of Ruina while seemingly not understanding the appeal of gacha games altogether. 

Mirror Dungeons are a fresh addition and are LC's strongest recurring gameplay loop. Essentially, they represent randomized dungeons with enemies from the previous chapters and are entirely separated from your actual progression in terms of Identities and character levels. Instead, every other tile you explore grants you passive power-ups. 

[h3]Story and Setting[/h3]
In Limbus Company, you are Dante, a man whose face is replaced by a clock with the ability to fairly literally pull sinners, your characters, from hell. It ties back into events from both Lobotomy Corporation and Ruina and features three chapters currently available. The issues here are twofold: Firstly, and more prominently, the game is tethered to a live-service design while being quite story-focused. This means lengthy content droughts between chapters that may make it hard to stay interested throughout its development. The other issue is a thematic one. Whereas the previous titles used intertextuality as a way to convey thematic elements of the story, Limbus Company is very literal. Religious iconography is now canonized as part of the worldbuilding through characters that are immediately tied to relevant mythology. 

One way to put this would be to call it style over substance. Instead of intertextuality as a means to convey underlying elements of the presented story, Limbus pushed your face into a book and asked whether you got it yet. Gregor is a man with a bug arm. It’s Kafka's Metamorphosis. You know Kafka, right? Dante and Vergil. Ishmael — what a cool name, and it's from literature too! This is deep and profound. In actuality, none of it feels like it adds anything meaningful to the overarching story that would work just as well without it. 

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
Whereas both LobCorp and LoR managed to innovate in their respective genres, Limbus simply writhes in the constraints of its own. Every design decision feels entirely counter to any sort of gacha — a genre that has an understandably bad reputation but can work in a game's favor, as can be seen in the more accomplished titles like Arknights or Azur Lane. In the end, I am not sure who Limbus is actually for. Fans of their previous games will see a stripped-bare Library of Ruina that seems to struggle to add anything worthwhile to the established story and world while also lacking the appeal of other gacha games.

Nevertheless, Project Moon has offered a competent roadmap going forward, and if you can stomach the slow pacing, you’ll find Limbus to be a fairly decent story experience due to its F2P-friendly design, though naturally, the underlying predatory monetization elements are still there. Much like Wonderlab and Distortion Detective, it's a fair enough game to reach for if you merely want more of Project Moon's world. Greed truly is the strongest sin.",7009,english

It has the needlessly complicated combat design of a PM game.
It has the incredibly confusing hints of a PM game.
It has the grindy nature of a PM game, only even more this time duo to being a gacha game.
What it lacks is a good story, which is the only real reason people that aren't masochists play their games.

At least up to chapter 3, the story is the worst in any PM entry, both in themes and how it's presented.
Pretentious writing for the sake of wordiness, current-year lingo written in the style of 'game translators' (though I don't know if the source material is any better), and several cases of ""show don't tell"".

In LoR, the whole reveal behind W corp's warp trains was gradual, showing the player every step of it through brief story sections and gameplay.
In Limbus, the truth behind J corp's singularity is just told to you in a cutscene by the ""I am smartest"" character, followed by multiple instances where it's shown and told to the player what it does... again.

The names of the sinners are at most dressing and at worst made for clickbait youtube videos. 
I have no idea what in Gregor's story in Chapter 1 has anything to do with Kafka's ""The metamorphosis"" besides almost coincidental similarities (They mentioned apples once!) even though he was based on it, down to his name. (Besides the fact he was turned into a bug, I guess)

The one part where an unnamed gang boss with a robotic body gets squashed by a hydraulic press is obviously made to look like Tipheret's death in LC, which is in poor fucking taste.
Comparing some random scum that leads a gang of fatasses that swear a lot to the tragic circumstances of Tipheret feels like a slap in the face for anyone who actually cares for the story.
The entirety of the second chapter felt like a comedy routine, almost like a slightly edgy SoL anime. You tell me if that ever came to mind when you thought of PM's writing.

I know the dull combat might be changed, I know all the bugs and QoL problems will be fixed, I know PM cares.
But I'm here for the story, and the story sucks. Unless they pull an LC and retranslate the entire script, I don't see the point in playing.",3744,english

This game's story GOES places. I mean, it looks all cute and cuddly on the surface, but those content warnings aren't for show. It's hard not to get emotionally invested, honestly ... It's kind of Kafkaesque to begin with, and just when you think you've gotten into the groove, it starts doing some straight up David Lynch stuff, or at least it feels that way. It does seem to largely explain the mind-screwage eventually, with some of the typical anime/visual novel style heavy handedness and quite a bit of charm and flair, which is not particularly Lynchian (he rarely explains much), but it's been some time since I felt as discombobulated (in a great way) by a video game's script. 

Its use of the formal elements of the medium and subverted expectations to intentionally pull the rug out from under the audience and leave it devastated, confused, and needing to go deeper is kind of a master class ... I mean, it doesn't quite have the philosophical depth of Pathologic 2, and definitely lacks the budget of a Kojima blockbuster, but what it manages to pull off with just a (fully voiced) visual novel interspersed with hours of seemingly disconnected dungeon-crawling is impressive. Eventually, the crawling and the story feel like part of one large and somewhat twisted puzzle-box mystery. The specifics are almost less important than the confidence of execution. 

Without any spoilers, I will warn that this game is NOT over when the credits roll for the first time. It's not too difficult to activate the second cycle, but you do need to do something very specific, at which point you will be able to start your ""new game plus"" / ""post-game"" - which is really just the continuations of the story and more game - think Nier Automata. It's essentially one story broken up into several ""campaigns."" If you've reached the credits and are feeling like the game was smaller and shorter than you expected, have no fear ... if it's more dungeons and floors that you want, it will oblige ... oh boy will it oblige ... and the same goes for story as well. 

** I will take a few meaningless, imaginary points off for a bit of gratuitous fan-service and the dialogue sexualizing a teenage girl at a few key points ... I do think the latter can be read more generously as a reflection on the character's anxieties as a vulnerable young woman in a fairly typically medievalish sexist society, and it does effectively read on that level to an extent. So I am not entirely ready to condemn it as pervy or gratuitous. But, like the first game (albeit much less often), it sometimes just gets raunchy for the sake of being raunchy, and that's rarely my personal cup of tea. Hardly detracts from the frankly stellar overall writing and character development.

Gameplay

I played the first one of this series on the PS4 a few years ago, and while I never quite finished it (something new and shiny came along and distracted me, I think), I loved every minute of it that I did play, so this was a no brainer for me. Hence, if you enjoyed the gameplay of Labyrinth of Refrain, you will largely feel at home here. Some might say it's too similar (in fact, a lot of the mechanics and art assets, specifically some of enemies and pretty much all of the puppet soldier art, are straight up reused), but there is no need to fix what ain't broken, and as this rather lengthy experience goes on, it continues to slowly build on that foundation and remix the established formula in what I felt to be interesting ways. 

If you've not played the original, well, it's like a modernized Wizardry, which is very much like Etrian Odyssey, or Persona Q, or SMT Strange Journey / Soul Hackers ... that sort of vibe. The two biggest components are dungeon exploration and party building and management. Combat is essentially a byproduct of the latter - if you build your party effectively, you'll rarely struggle too much even on nightmare world difficulty ... most of the time. Either way, it does effectively give one the joy of constantly tweaking and optimizing, upgrading weapons, trying out different brigade configurations with different covens and coven compositions, and so on. 

Navigating the labyrinth is generally good fun and neither too challenging nor so simple as to be boring - it's a lot of vertical thinking, resource management, and strategic risk taking, along with the usual genre staples like illusory walls, moving floors, teleporter tiles, switches, and so on. There are occasional procedurally generated floor blocks in certain sequences of the game, but they are still regularly broken up by bespoke, hand designed floors, and aren't particularly tedious, even featuring some unique choices and events on occasion. 

Aside from all that, there are a few welcome quality of life features that take a lot of the tedium out of the difficulty these kinds of games sometimes hit you with and are worth a mention. A party wipe does not result in losing hard progress, so even if you do screw up, you'll only lose some currency and rapport (which is a background thing that isn't worth micromanaging too much). The XP stockpile feature is back from the previous game and offers a very nice risk reward balance as well as a convenient way to quickly power level new puppet soldiers. The meat system, wherein enemies drop XP granting items after every battle, also makes it easy to bring new party members up to snuff. Just stockpile the meat until you need to make a new puppet, and then just cram all of it down it's throat at once and watch those levels go up. 

I do find that wiping as a result of an accidental fall can be quite frustrating at times, but it does offer a real sense of danger to the pitfalls, and the relatively forgiving wipe consequences take some of the sting out (of course, if you've stockpiled hundreds of thousands of XP and lose it all, it can cause that sinking Dark Souls feeling of ""I lost all my souls to gravity"" But again, it's risk and reward. 

English Voice Acting

Good. Madame Martha and Eureka can get a bit grating sometimes, simply because of the exagerrated cadences the actors were clearly directed to maintain ... most of the time ... but those cadences do serve a purpose, and both characters are enjoyable all the way through. 

Artwork

Excellent character and monster designs. Great VN portraits and backdrops. Nice textures on the dungeons. Solidly stylish UI. A bit too fan servicy for my taste on the puppet soldier art, but the art itself is still good regardless. Music is great, vibes are good ... or very bad, but , like, intentionally so.   

Overall

If you're into jrpgs or rpgs in general but aren't a huge drpg / gridder / blobber person, I think this one has some real crossover potential and is still worth a try. If you're into drpgs / wizardry clones, etc. this is a no brainer - both this game and its predecessor form one of the best series in the genre to come out of Japan in recent memory, and an easy contender with all the greats, including, in my opinion, SMT Strange Journey. If you're a hardcore Call of Duty player, or if you really need high end graphics and fully animated cutscenes, this is probably not it, though.",5499,english
0,steam_reviews/2021910_FPSChess.json,20327,1,"This is the greatest version of chess in today's current society. The visual design is striking, with a harsh and bright aesthetic being used to hide the truly Shakespearean levels of depth and tragedy in the true lore of the game, which I won't go into due to spoilers. The meticulous art direction and dazzling use of subtle, ""show, don't tell"" techniques leads to a beautiful and haunting experience  that I will cherish for the rest of my life. 

Story aside, the gameplay truly speaks for itself. Each interaction, careful and meticulous, feels like an elegant dance between two foes, fighting for their own lives and ideals, making you feel empathetic, even towards your most hated nemesis. The way each piece flows like water in the players hands leads to a combat system that stands among the titans of this industry, such as Doom or Devil May Cry V. 

The balancing is immaculate, with each Hero having its own place amongst the cast. The Pawn, with his brilliant use of comradery and friendship to create an on the fly ally alongside his high potential for movement techniques leads to one of the most core Heroes of the game being one of your most valued members. The Knight, with his noble bow and arrow, striking from afar to put fear into the opponents heart, making them cower behind cover, only to be destroyed nonetheless. The Bishop, with his graceful gliding through the open air, letting you discover a new world of versatility and freedom amongst the sky. The Rook, with his carefully placed shots ending even the strongest of foes in only a matter of moments, left bleeding and helpless under the ruthless glint of his scope. The Queen and her terrifying machine-gun raining hellfire from above, using her own comrades as cover in a show of pure, Kafkaesque brutality to gain any advantage over her foes. As the Yin to her Yang, The King is a benevolent leader,  using an honorable great-sword and drawing the foe in close for a graceful and honorable duel to their final breath, giving even the most despicable, disgraceful opponents another chance to atone and fight without malice. The combat is truly something that cannot be described, and must be experienced. The perfect mixture of challenge, skill, and intellect, this is truly the Dark Souls of Chess games.

The map design is immaculate. I'd dare to say that it is even timeless! The careful sculpting of each individual inch of the map shows in both gameplay, and from the eye of a true artist. The table that you originally believe that confines you is able to be broken, the Heroes shattered into pieces, you may break free of your shackles and escape to the outer edges of the room! This is a beautiful piece of narrative storytelling, allowing to player to quite literally break out of their cage and experience the world anew. My biggest gripe with the map is the gramophone to the east of the board. This small section of the map allows for a cowardly retreat and heal technique that ruins even the most professional of matches. All in all, the map is fantastic, and the player controlled escape of their chains truly left a tear in my eye the first time I discovered it. We have needed this tasteful commentary on the ending of the African slave trade that went on in the United States of America in the early 19th century, and still holds true to the racial prejudice that goes on to this day.

Overall, this game is a masterpiece. I will play this for many moons to come, and am glad that I was on the earth at the same time as this gift from god. My children and grandchildren and grandchildren's grandchildren will hear tales of this legendary game for eons to come. Through my extensive time with this game, my experience as the greatest FPS Chess player in North America, and overall perspective as an artist, I can indubitably confirm; that this is a hood classic.

0,steam_reviews/2066020_SoulstoneSurvivors.json,11675,1,"存在主義（Existentialism）是一種社會思潮，
19世紀中發源並盛行到二戰之後。它不只是學院裡的哲學，更是社會、宗教與藝術的潮流。

你可能聽過一些比較有名的存在主義哲學家名號，例如沙特（Jean-Paul Sartre）、
克果（Søren Kierkegaard）、尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）、馬瑟爾（Gabriel Marcel）等。

雖然這些哲學家共同關心「人怎麼活」的問題，但各自的回答很不同。

譬如，齊克果作為一名虔誠的基督徒，主張應該當一個「非凡的基督徒」
（雖然教會普遍不接受他的學說），而尼采則認為應該將人生經營成「藝術品」。

除了關心類似的問題，存在主義者通常有一些熱衷討論的概念，
包括盲信、荒謬、真實性 （facticity） 、他者、焦慮、絕望等。
也因此，存在主義開啟了一個傳統上哲學家並不非常擅長的副本任務：
將各種生命情境「帶」到人們面前。

為了觸碰這些問題，以此主題來創作的文學家包括卡謬 （Albert Camus） 、
赫塞 （Hermann Hesse） 與卡夫卡 （Franz Kafka） 等等，
他們依此開闢了另一條讓人檢視存在課題的路徑。

從這些哲學表現的多樣，你可以看出存在主義者之間並沒有特定的哲學或文學的方法論。
然而沙特曾經總結，認為存在主義者其實有個共同信條：「存在先於本質」。

▎存在？本質？

歐陸哲學的基本訓練之一，是小心區分術語間的細微差異。
要妥善理解「存在先於本質」，我們必須知道「存在」和「本質」有什麼不同。
在語詞的探討上， 歐陸哲學家有一種常見的「招式」，是從字源出發，
然後再加工（因為歐陸哲學家製造術語的時候，也通常都會從字原有的意義來進行）。
在這裡我們或許可以這樣 試試看：

「存在」（exist）的字源是拉丁文的「ex」 （向外） 與「stare」 （站） 。

因此，「存在」帶有「（從某處） 站出來」或「去成為某東西」的意思。

「本質 （essence）」是從「esse」（to be）而來。

因此，「本質」指的是事物「真正的本性」註1。

重點在於，「本質」比「存在」更加純粹。

例如說，我們也許能夠從各種方式使用遊戲、玩遊戲、說遊戲、想遊戲、看遊戲，
把握各種遊戲的「存在」，但是這些又沒有一個稱得上是遊戲的本質。

當我們談到「存在」，就像是只談到了事物的特定條件下的特定樣貌。
相較之下，若是談到本質，就像是我們談到了一件事物的核心。

「本質」看起來純純淨淨，但「存在」則充滿各種多樣複雜的面向（髒髒亂亂的），
而且單單從各種面向來看都滿片面的，
也難怪古典哲學家如柏拉圖會認為如果有永恆的價值的話，應該要存在於本質那裡。

---

換句話說價值先於存在，然而對於遊戲玩家而言，可能是先有存在再有價值

You experience this realm through he face of Tous les jours, who returns from their 57-year retirement from a René Magritte painting, one so aptly surreal that to don the facade of any other cultural landmark would be so reprehensible it would've walked itself out the back door of your mind before it ever coalesces into a cohesive thought. Year after year, I've asked myself who I am, but no longer. I have peered behind the curtain into the eyes of the galactic stagehands, as they peered also into me. Through me.

One may prod for aeons at the abstract themes which perforate this pin-cushion of an experience, but I ask you not to look within the game for answers, but to yourself. Who do we owe our world to, I ask? Who does the job that none others have the gumption to undertake? I'll tell you, what do all of the following people have in common - Warhol. Diogenes. Napoleon. Einstein. My mate Greg. That's right - none of them are bin men.

None of them undergo the tumultuous christening of patience and persistence, an unyielding and unbreakable sense of duty to which our modern life is owed; breaking our backs so we can break our fast. It is through this catalytic process in the blazing crucible of duty that one's mind, soul, and body is carved. I am currently incarcerated at 25.0000° N, 71.0000° W, please send help. The people who give by taking, the greedily generous, upon whom the lack of which would lead to irreparable societal collapse, and who once, in a blue moon, are brave enough to show us mercy for our misdeeds. (I left a tin can in the cardboard recycling and they took it after leaving a stern note.)

This game is not simply an exploration of who we are, but crucially, who we aren't, and why we aren't, and who we might not otherwise be if we were somebody else, perhaps at some other time, in a similar or completely different location. Perhaps even what we could've been if we wouldn't've had to have been who we were supposed to have become when we could've had to have likewise been someone dissimilar, or something equally verbose. It's all here in the game, plain as day, and I for one am grateful for experiencing the infinite boon of the humble bin man.

This game is a stern reminder that when you go to the zoo to look at the monkeys, the monkeys will also look back at you, and if Dali and Kafka owned timeshare it would look like this. 🗿/🗿, I am now petrified of stone, and will never experience the sensation of touch again.",79,english

Hedgehog as he grapples with issues of identity, a fitting follow-up for the first game's exploration of his sexuality and search for belonging in a world he does not feel like he fits into. He is constantly besieged by a mysterious apparition known only as ""The Shadow"" - which, to educated players, should be immediately apparent as an overt application of Jungian psychology, as The Shadow represents the parts of Sonic that he desperately tries to not aknowledge, as well as manifesting his insecurities: where Sonic attempts to be heroic, noble, and fast, The Shadow is a cruel, villainous sort, heralding Sonic's constant inner battle against his latent nihilism and pro-capitalistic attitude, an aspect of his character that is also explored in his obsession with ""Rings"", the main currency of Hedgehog Earth. Worth noting is that The Shadow does not have Sonic's speed - instead opting to have his racing prowess augmented  by a pair of rocket-enhanced shoes, symbolizing Sonic's constant insecurity and fear - running is all he is good at, what if he one day could not run as quickly without aid? What use would there then be for him? He literally can not see himself as anything else than someone who runs fast, and his self-esteem suffers for it. There are some Kafka-esque overtones to this subplot, punctuated by Lynchian dream sequences in which Sonic takes on the appearance of Doctor Eggman, his therapist, as he rampages through a derelict shipyard in a large robot, freeing animals from the cold clutches of other, slightly smaller robots. These scenes are often contrasted by the non-chronological vignettes wherein we play as Tail The Hedgehog; these ultimately only exist to expand upon the backstory of Sonic's relationship with Jamie Hedgehog, however, while the Doctor Eggman scenes tend to revolve around Sonic's trust issues. There is also a minor subplot concerning Knuckles The Hedgefund, and his supposedly controversial inter-racial relationship with Rogue The Boat, but this is ultimately only inserted to make the game an appropriate length (five and a half hours) and these stages were all removed in the Director's Cut.

The user interface is a mess so convoluted, it feels like it was designed as a practical joke on anyone with an IQ above room temperature. It's a bewildering cacophony of colors and symbols that could make even an experienced player question their sanity. I have to wonder, were the developers trying to make a game or conduct a psychological experiment on human frustration tolerance?

The chat window? Don't get me started on that. It's like they took the term ""clutter"" as a personal challenge. It's less of a communication tool and more of a chaotic mess of overlapping text, gibberish, and unrelated conversations. Having a meaningful discussion there is like trying to find a whisper in a rock concert. It's like they're actively discouraging players from interacting.

And let's talk about the missing game roles. It's like the creators decided to rob the game of its essence by taking away some of our favorite roles. It's as if they've decided to snatch away a little piece of our enjoyment, just because they can.

Sauf que ces théories du jeu qui fonctionne mieux sur du vieux matos se vérifient (avec pillars of eternity par exemple). Bref, des devs qui ont voulu écouter les fans hardcore gamer et ont fait un jeu déséquilibré, tu peux te taper une zone entière à te faire C**** comme un rat et hop, d'un coup d'un seul un monstre sort et te bousille la tronche en un coup, ouiaip. Pareil en mode élite, il faut se taper ce big monstre dans le cimetière, c'est faisable, mais lourdingue au possible dans une arène riquiqui, ça s'est un vrai point noir, tu ne peux pas bouger dans cette zone, il te crache des champions, des trucs de partout...Au final, tu utilises un cheat pour avancer et passer ce moment chiant comme la mort (sans mauvais jeu de mot) qui te débloque la suite de l'aventure.

- I very, very carefully and cautiously gathered a decent amount of stuff. Then, I suddenly died. 
- I wandered around inside three gigantic apartment buildings, each of which was completely empty.
- I tried a dfferent server, hoping those buildings would have some gear. I spawned underneath the floor and starved to death. 
- A zombie clipped through the walls and ate me.
- I clipped through the earth itself. Showing my flexibility as a man, I began swimming through the very soil like a mole. 
- A zombie clipped through the walls and ate me. 
- A zombie clipped through the walls and ate me.

Usually early access games are weird and glitchy. But DayZ is cool. It's the best, most philosophically charged walking simulation I know of -- you can die at almost any moment with no apparent reason. And the ability to swim through the earth like a mole reminded me a lot of Kafka's Metamorphosis. Very haunting. 

There were some bugs though. For instance, there didn't appear to be anything to do at all in the game. But I'm happy to see that the devs are working on a lot of very, very important changes, such as putting an AK-47 or changing the animation when you eat from a can. As long as the devs don't do something stupid like make it so that zombies can't clip right through the walls, I'll keep playing for the foreseeable future. Thumbs up.",612,english
0,steam_reviews/2211730_KILLBUG.json,137,1,"This game is fan-fucking-tastic. 
Buy it now, it is 7.99.

The movement is relatively simple (double jump, wall run, melee boost) but very fluid and expressive.

So far I've only seen one gun, it feels like a sped up pea shooter (in a good way, it's proficient, but you can't rely solely on it) if you fire for too long it overheats, occasionally it gets these fucking runes around the barrel and you get one powerful shot (no clue how or why, and i like the mystery right now). 

There is a melee that goes through multiple bugs, cooling down your gun and healing you based on how many (and maybe what type) of bugs you kill with it. If you jump after the melee it will boost you, it feels very good.

The visuals are lofi, but very pleasant. Alot of green, textures that look like leaves. The bug enemies are cute and maybe a little intimidating (mostly cute).

I've heard one song so far, it jams and it fits the buggy setting. Kind of reminds me of some of the tracks on Risk of Rain 2, minus the keyboard solos, and more bug themed.

The game loop is spawning in and taking on endless waves of bugs. First ladybugs that lunge when they get close, soon after bees that launch projectiles, centipedes that snake around the arena and are taken out segment by segment, slugs that leave poison trails, a hive that launches a swarm of projectiles. This is as far as I've gotten. The bugs are very fast, so you'll fire your gun until you get a good opportunity to take out multiple bugs with melee, reposition on a wall, and find a slightly more clear area to lead them into.

 It's very simple, but very satisfying, worth more than what it's priced at. I would easily pay 20 bucks for this game. Great for when you want to shut off your brain and let the flow take over.

Seriously just go buy it.

0,steam_reviews/221910_TheStanleyParable.json,43367,17,"The Stanley Parable es uno de los juegos más inteligentes que he jugado en mucho tiempo. Mucho, mucho tiempo. Aunque antes de continuar debería aclarar que hablo de títulos cuya principal virtud no es la mecánica de juego. En ese supuesto, Stanley es un juego inteligente, sí, pero no más que Civilization V: Brave New World o Dota 2, por poner dos ejemplos. Hablo de juegos en los que la narrativa es preminente y, ahí, Stanley brilla con luz propia.

The Stanley Parable es juego y se siente feliz de serlo.  Por mucho que algunos insistan, no es una mera experiencia interactiva. Expresión, por cierto, que algunos usan como si fueran médicos que le dicen a unos constritos padres que su hijo tiene down. Stanley es  propuesta y es resolución. Lo que cabría cuestionar es quién propone y quién resuelve. Es decir, quién juega con quién. En la mayoría de juegos el jugador juega con el juego. ¿Sucede lo mismo en Stanley?

La propuesta de The Stanley Parable es aparentemente sencilla: Elige una serie de caminos y disfruta de la experiencia. No hay juego, fin. No es tan sencillo. ¿Qué hay de los procesos mentales que surgen antes y después de cada elección? ¿Qué hay de la anticipación del narrador? ¿Acaso no es nuestra confusa mente una pantallla en la que el narrador está respondiendo a nuestras propuestas? Evidentemente no, pero la percepción es que sí. Por eso es un juego inteligente. Que es decir que por eso es juego y por eso es inteligente.

El narrador merece un aparte. Cuando empecé a jugar la comparación era con Bastion. Mirando atrás, ahora se me antoja una comparación imposible. El narrador de Bastion no deja de ser eso, un narrador que cuenta una historia, más o menos sencilla, en respuesta a lo que el jugador va haciendo, hasta completar un pequeño relato, más o menos bueno, una vez el juego concluye. El narrador de Stanley es mucho más. Es narrador, es interlocutor, es creador, es jugador. El narrador de Stanley es la parábola de Stanley, es Stanley.

Con todo, el juego adolece de consistencia. Y no hablo de consistencia en las situaciones: en la construcción de cada camino, en la originalidad de las resoluciones, en la agudeza de los análisis. No, hablo de consistencia conceptual. Hay consistencia en la idea de la elección. No podía ser de otra manera. Pero dentro de esa idea, hay un gran desequilibrio en las propuestas.

Cuando el juego cuestiona las elecciones vitales, el resultado no es óptimo. No es malo, pero se queda muy lejos de alcanzar el nivel de otros medios de creación, especialmente el literario, en el que las dudas que levantó Schopenhauer sobre la voluntad en la elección han sido discutidas hasta la saciedad. Por no hablar del laberinto psicológico que propuso Kafka. En esta vertiente, Stanley se achica, se avejenta, se muestra como una reflexión rehecha, una idea que llega tarde a la discusión. Cien años tarde.

Sin embargo, cuando entra en el campo del metajuego, cuando se cuestiona a sí mismo como entidad creativa, aporta reflexiones que deberían tener mucho más eco del que tienen. De alguna manera, The Stanley Parable es el gran juego epistémico de nuestros días. Es cierto que las cuestiones son escasas, que las reflexiones son superficiales, pero no es menos cierto que hay que saber valorar que esas preguntas estén integradas en un juego de forma tan clarividente. Ser pionero es meritorio en sí mismo.

En definitiva, aquí hay mucho más que un juego loco con comentarios graciosos. Hay mucho más que caminos que llevan a finales estrambóticos, casi siempre inesperados. Hay mucho más que elecciones simples o rebuscadas. Por encima de todo eso –razones más que suficientes para jugarlo–, está su capacidad de cuestionar los límites de los videojuegos, de proponer una solución: los videojuegos serán mientras tengan la capacidad de reinventarse.",475,spanish

0,steam_reviews/221910_TheStanleyParable.json,43367,17,"Like Dear Esther and Thirty Flights of Venerating, The Stanley Representation is an endeavor differing things with canny record, another attempt to discover another kind of depicting excellent to PC diversions. It's engaging, self-referential, shocking, and every once in a while uncomfortable to play, a story related not through one direct story but rather through a broad assortment of fanning ways that curves the dubiousness of control that PC amusements work so difficult to give us. 

You may know The Stanley Story from its 2011 cycle as a Half-Life 2 mod. I didn't, as it happens, yet this has a basically more mind boggling modification of that idea, no longer made of Half-Life resources and hugely connected by maker Davey Wreden as a gathering with William Pugh. The Stanley Story begins in a standard work region area in a shrewdly dull looking office, cursor sparkling on the screen of a beige screen. You are Stanley, an agreeable salaryman who spends his days respectfully creating summons in a diminish work territory extend. One day, the majority of his partners vanish, surrendering him to investigate the workplace alone in the relationship of an avuncular storyteller. 

This storyteller detest Dear Esther's bright, careful speaker, with his stories about dissidents and goats and verse. He prods, reprimands, gets drained or irate with you, whispers conspiratorially with you and – in particular – lets you know what to do to instigate the story as you investigate an office that is startling in its harshness, from the uniform covering to the propelling expressions on the whiteboards and non specific nature depictions, in every practical sense everything stamped with a number. 

My actuate sense was to disregard the voice in my cerebrum, yet regardless you try to subvert it, The Stanley Tale is set up with yet another readied condition, another lump of witty script, promptly annoying and remunerating you for endeavoring to stray from the set way – notwithstanding the way that, and this is the basic point, everything is a set course in The Stanley Story, and it reprimands the mind flight of decision. You imagine that you're controlling the result, in light of current conditions it's dependably the storyteller controlling you. 

I expect the purpose behind The Stanley Outline, on the off chance that you feel constrained to discover a show it, is well while in transit to see the vast majority of its differing endings and changes, which turning out from pivotal decisions – like taking the entryway on the left, or the gateway on the advantage – into trade plotlines with further augmenting occasions, fanning outwards to sporadic conclusions. The substance ""the end is never the end"" floats over the screen when you discover one of these endings, and you are come back to Stanley's work space to begin again. 

What's bewildering is the route by which constrained conditions and plainly restricted decisions incite such a generous number of various results. Here and there you'll settle on precisely the same and something else will happen, as the storyteller changes track. In around a hour I discovered seven fascinating endings, and when I saw another person play, they found another two that I'd never viewed. 

My first Stanley Account experience was a Kafkaesque bureaucratic shocking dream where each endeavor I made to sharpen my essentialness of decision drove me more noteworthy to a tenaciously inflexible, inevitable course of action of charges that I had no honest to goodness elective however to take in the wake of, winding up at ground zero in my passing. Some of its stages trap you in unlimited circles, compelled to listen to the storyteller pontificate until he condescends to give you another demand. The storyteller's aggregate control over what you can do and when you can do it now and again makes him feel like a correctional facility screen; unmistakable times he's a sidekick, an assistant, a delicate engaging associate. 

It's a really odd trouble for some person before long acquainted with PC diversions and their essentials. You have to break them, however the storyteller is always a couple wanders before you, lastly you're left tending to what the inspiration driving decision is at all in a framework where each change is laid out for you and some omniscient storyteller has every one of the reserves of being set up to anticipate all that you may do. The best way to The Stanley Account's engaging ""best"" conclusion is to take after the storyteller's headings and do as you're told like a not all that awful little droid, and a little while later a violently twist accomplishment appears commending you for ""beating the preoccupation"". 

In context of its prelude, I thought The Stanley Outline may be a festival of decision, of the power that we need to break out of our life's repressions by in a general sense acting all of a sudden, however that is precisely The Stanley Story assaults. I speculated that it was remarkably uncomfortable to play on occasion, similar to I was gotten in it – it's the nearest a distraction has ever come to duplicating that inclination being stuck in a dull dream. The title screen – a recursive photograph of a screen demonstrating similar Start screen – mirrors that unease. 

It's in like way especially captivating, generally because of a sharp script and the storyteller's vivacious execution, and makes visit attacks into the dreamlike and incredible. One of the endings, especially, is an amazingly illustrate joke that gets all the all the more intriguing and cleverer as it goes on, and made me giggle more than any redirection since Entryway. Where The Stanley Story's demo was a light joke of PC preoccupation traditions – unquestionably go play that, in the event that you haven't beginning now, it's a standalone thing - the full stimulation is impressively more bizarre, and less constrained especially. 

Infrequently The Stanley Tale feels like an examination of the particular free for all of weariness. Particular times it's something else all around: a joke at the player's cost, a distribution on decision and result, a joke, a bureaucratic horrendous dream. All its arranged plotlines and characters cover and join to make something that is intriguingly dinky, however continually dazzling, and really captivating. Whatever it can't abstain from being, it legitimizes playing.

Never has one game relied so heavily on the strength of a single voice. You either buy into the narrator and hitch yourself to this Kafka-esque wagon of ennui and determinism or you shut off the computer in disgust and go cry in a corner. 

This game needs to be longer. It has an idea of the infinite at its core but does not actually reward replaying. Oh sure... you replay the game. but there is no reward involved. Just a sense that maybe you might have missed something important like a niggling in the back of your skull. So you play it again. But you don't find anything and that is clearly not the game's fault. So you play it again. And this time you're absolutely positive that you quite probably missed something and maybe if you play it one more time then you will find it...

Eventually though you hit that realization that there really is nothing more. This is it. Oh sure... there might be more achievements but you're not sure exactly what they might be.

0,steam_reviews/221910_TheStanleyParable.json,43367,17,"Filter Kafka through the sensibilities of Douglas Adams and you might end up with something like The Stanley Parable. It is not so much a game as a bewildering tree of short stories to explore, all featuring the same main character and all circling the themes of free will and purpose, while lampooning videogame mechanics. Button presser Stanley finds himself in an office devoid of colleagues and sets out to explore what is going on. As he roams the halls, a sardonic narrator points out what Stanley is doing and – crucially – what he is about to do. (Also see: Stranger Than Fiction.) But you are free to go against his prompts and the game even expects you to do so, as otherwise it would be a really, really short experience. You can’t really do much except occasionally press some buttons and open a door. Most of the joy comes from exasperating the narrator (Kevan Brighting), who sounds a lot like he is channeling Peter Jones, the voice of The Guide from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. It is the funniest, best-written narration since G.L.A.D.O.S. from Portal, voice-acted to perfection. One of the highlights of the game actually had me just hang around in a pointless broom closet while the voice scolded me.

There are various endings, but these aren’t endings at all in most cases, and you will inevitably end up circling back to the beginning. It’s never clear when you’re done, as it’s always possible you missed a branch of story somewhere, something the game itself also points out. The game is very ‘meta’ and will poke fun at what you’re doing – or not doing – and the expectations you may have of a game. A sinister countdown that pokes fun at your helplessness is probably the best example of this. (But are you really helpless?) And there is an ‘achievement’ that will have completists grit their teeth, which is to not play the game for five years. So I’ve got something to look forward to in 2018. There is also an achievement simply called ‘Unachievable’. But is it? Be prepared to cheat a little, by way of a walkthrough, when you feel like you have seen all there is to see. There are a few Easter eggs you are likely to miss unless you spend ages bumping around every corner of the office until desperation sets in.

The only downside to The Stanley Parable is unavoidable repetition, as you will have to run through the same spaces a lot to get to the diverging branch you want to explore. Though occasionally there will be a small change – a new voicemail to listen to, a new comment by the voiceover – parts get too samey. Movement is fast, thankfully, but when rushing from one place to the next, the voiceover gets cut off awkwardly at points, when you trigger a new one before the old one is done.

All in all, The Stanley Parable is a unique experience and one that should not be missed. When you look into this game, this game also looks into you. I look forward to revisiting it again, in time, when I’ve forgotten most of the narration. But not until five years have passed, of course, as I really want that achievement.

Now I absolutely love adventure games. It's my absolute favorite genre of games and the staple of this genre is cryptic puzzles, but in most adventure games there are only a few puzzles that are cryptic, but Hamlet and the rest of the name I won't even retype the entire game is cryptic. 

You won't be able to solve all of the puzzles without resorting to a guide. Now let me explain a bit why some of the puzzles are just way too hard. In one puzzle the little alien guy is knocked out and to wake him up you have to make him think 2x2=4 which is not explained anywhere and you only think of it logically and imagine now that the entire game is full of puzzles like that and you have yourself this game.

The game is also incredibly short. With a guide (which you will definitely use by the end of act 1) will take you around an hour finish the entire game and after that there is next to no replay value what so ever.

This game also sets up a sequel and since this game came out in 2012 and there's no sign of the sequel I highly doubt it will see the light of day. The developer of this game is also working on Franz Kafka The Game which is supposed to release in 2017 so hopefully his mistakes on Hamlet are fixed in that game.

In the end this game is bad. It's only saving grace is the rather cute art style. Apart from that there's literally no reason to play this game as it's too cryptic. I suggest skipping this and picking something else.

Final Rating:
4/10

Pros:
+ The Art Style

Cons:
- Puzzles are way too cryptic 
- Short

This is a little treasure of a game. It's so cute and well thought-out and has so many fun little details to discover. In short, it's the perfect game for a rainy Sunday afternoon. 

The puzzles are surprisingly tough at times, at least they were for me. There are so few things to interact with and still the game manages to hide the solutions from you pretty well. Of course, there are very easy puzzles, too. It's a short game. 
The art style is cute and the music fits very well. 

If I had to criticise something, I'd say that the game doesn't feel very Shakespeare-y. The story just borrows some characters and parts of the story, but doesn't attempt to create a special atmosphere around them. That's what I loved about the Kafka game, the other, newer game made by Denis Galanin and it would have made this game even better, I think. But I absolutely recommend it as it is.

Non c'è una storia, ma i personaggi, i suoni e l'architettura disegnano un mondo distrutto, abbandonato da tutto, in cui VORRESTI SCOPRIRE come è stato reso così. Gli esseri umani come simulacri abbandonati a un mondo ormai cancellato dal tempo. Erano 30 anni che speravo che qualcuno esprimesse questo contenuto. Un gioco di un realismo sui nostri simili e sulla razza umana attuale senza precedenti. Si vede che la cosa è frutto di una mente notevole e incredibilmente acuta; descrive un mondo in cui la ruota del tempo si è fermata nel tempo attuale immaginando un'umanità che rimarrà ferma in questo oggi per sempre, e quanto si vede è con crudezza il nostro reale presente. E' chiaramente un'opera d'arte. Per niente mancante di cure. In pratica esprime in tutta la sua potenza ciò che il primo DOOM, o il primo need for speed most wanted fecero intuire con i paesaggi e le ambientazioni. Purtroppo il gameplay è quel che è, ma infatti il gioco sembra più un ""dono autentico"" al pubblico. Prodotto da una mente di certo non banale. Un viaggio dantesco.

Certainly not a fun game, but a MONSTER atmosphere... aesthetically reminiscent of the film ""THE TRIAL"" by Orson Welles who staged Kafka's work of the same name, which is saying something. There is no story, but the characters, the sounds and the architecture draw a world destroyed, abandoned by everything, in which YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT how it was made like this. Human beings as simulacra abandoned in a world now erased by time. I've been hoping for 30 years for someone to express this content. A game of unprecedented realism about our fellow humans and the current human race. It can be seen that the thing is the fruit of a remarkable and incredibly sharp mind; describes a world in which the wheel of time has stopped in the present time, imagining a humanity that will remain stationary in this today forever, and what we see is our real present with crudeness. It is clearly a work of art. Not at all lacking in care. In practice it expresses in all its power what the first DOOM, or the first need for speed most wanted made us intuit with the landscapes and settings. Unfortunately the gameplay is what it is, but in fact the game feels more like a ""genuine gift"" to the public. Produced by a mind that is certainly not trivial. A Dantesque journey.",14,italian
0,steam_reviews/2263010_Pineappleonpizza.json,16426,1,"As a connoisseur of all things refined and sophisticated, I have played many games that claim to be masterpieces. However, none of them have ever come close to the sheer brilliance and complexity of ""Pineapple on Pizza."" This game is a true work of art, inspired by the infamous food dish that has been both celebrated and criticized for years.
Indeed, there is much more to say about ""Pineapple on Pizza,"" a game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape.
As I reflect further on ""Pineapple on Pizza,"" I cannot help but be struck by the way in which the game speaks to the human condition. Through its use of symbolism and metaphor, the game is able to explore complex themes in a way that is both engaging and accessible.

At first glance, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" may seem like a simple game, but this is far from the truth. The game is a stunning display of artistic expression, combining the traditional elements of a platformer with the intricacies of puzzle-solving. The graphics are a true marvel, with each level presenting a unique and breathtaking landscape that is sure to leave any player in awe.


One of the most impressive aspects of ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is the way it challenges players to think in new and creative ways. Each achievement presents a series of challenges that require careful planning and execution to overcome. It is not enough to simply jump and run your way through the game. To truly succeed, players must use their minds and think outside the box.

Another impressive aspect of ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is its visual and auditory design. The game's graphics are stunning, with each section of the level presenting a unique and breathtaking landscape that is sure to leave players in awe. The attention to detail is incredible, with everything from the game's characters to its environmental elements designed with an eye for beauty and elegance.

Similarly, the game's sound design is masterful, with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's themes and atmosphere. The game's use of sound effects is also impressive, with every action and interaction in the game producing a unique and satisfying sound that adds to the overall immersion and sense of satisfaction.

The game's storyline is equally captivating, drawing players in with its deep and complex themes. At its core, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is a commentary on the duality of human nature, exploring the conflict between our base desires and our higher aspirations. The pineapple topping represents our desire for sweetness and pleasure, while the pizza crust represents our need for structure and discipline. Together, these two elements form a delicious and satisfying whole, just as our base instincts and higher aspirations must coexist to create a balanced and fulfilling life.
A narrative, which manages to be both deeply personal and universal at the same time. Through the journey of the game's protagonist, players are taken on a journey of self-discovery and growth, exploring themes such as identity, purpose, and belonging. The game's characters are richly drawn, with each one representing a different aspect of the human experience. The game's writing is poetic and evocative, with a language that is both accessible and profound.

In many ways, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is reminiscent of the works of Franz Kafka, particularly his novel ""The Metamorphosis."" Both works explore the tension between the individual and society, highlighting the ways in which our desires and dreams can be at odds with the expectations and norms of those around us. Like Kafka, the creators of ""Pineapple on Pizza"" have crafted a world that is both surreal and hauntingly familiar, a place where the line between reality and fantasy is blurred.
The Symbolism and Methopors might well surpass Kafka in this regard. The pineapple on pizza is not simply a food item, but a symbol of the conflicting desires that drive us all. The game's use of light and darkness, color and shadow, and order and chaos all serve as metaphors for the struggles and challenges that we face in our lives. These symbols are woven seamlessly into the game's design, adding depth and meaning to every interaction and decision.

The creators of the game have crafted a singular level that is truly a work of art, incorporating elements of platforming, puzzle-solving, and storytelling into a cohesive whole. The level is designed to challenge players in a variety of ways, with each section building upon the previous one to create a sense of progression and growth.

Additionally, the game's singular focus on a single level allows players to fully immerse themselves in the experience, exploring every nook and cranny and discovering new secrets and hidden areas. It is a testament to the game's design that players can spend hours exploring the level and still find new things to discover.

While some may scoff at the notion of a game with only one level, the sheer depth and complexity of ""Pineapple on Pizza"" more than make up for this apparent limitation. The game's singular level is a masterpiece of design, incorporating elements of platforming, puzzle-solving, and storytelling into a seamless and cohesive whole.

Furthermore, the game's singular focus on a single level can be seen as a statement on the nature of creativity and innovation. In a world where many games are content to simply repeat the same formula over and over again, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" stands out as a bold and daring experiment in game design. The creators of the game have shown that it is possible to create something truly original and groundbreaking, even within the constraints of a single level.
Every aspect of the game, from its controls to its mechanics, has been carefully crafted to create an experience that is both challenging and rewarding. The game's puzzles are clever and inventive, requiring players to think outside the box and use their creativity to overcome obstacles. The platforming sections are precise and satisfying, with a level of polish that is rare in modern gaming. The game's pacing is also exceptional, with each section building upon the last to create a sense of momentum and progress.
It is worth noting that its game that rewards exploration and experimentation. Players who take the time to search every nook and cranny of the level will be rewarded with hidden treasures and secret areas. The game also allows players to experiment with different approaches to challenges, encouraging them to find their own unique solutions to problems.

At its core, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is a game about balance and harmony, exploring the relationship between the sweet and the savory, the chaotic and the structured, and the base and the refined. The game's eponymous food dish serves as a metaphor for this balance, with the pineapple representing our desire for sweetness and pleasure, and the pizza crust representing our need for structure and discipline. Together, these two elements create a dish that is greater than the sum of its parts, much like how our base instincts and higher aspirations must coexist to create a balanced and fulfilling life.

Of course, like any truly great work of art, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is not for everyone. Its complexity and depth may be lost on those who are not willing to invest the time and effort needed to truly appreciate it. But for those who are willing to take the plunge, the rewards are truly unparalleled.

In conclusion, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is a true masterpiece of gaming, a work of art that is sure to be remembered for years to come. It is a game that challenges players to think deeply and creatively, while also offering a stunning visual and auditory experience. Like the food dish it is inspired by, ""Pineapple on Pizza"" is a taste sensation that is sure to leave players craving more. After all, there is never too much pineapple on pizza.
Truly a masterpiece that changed gaming as we knew it and opened our eyes to the future.-",10711,english
0,steam_reviews/227000_Primordia.json,3021,1,"Primordia is an attempt at a weighty story that somewhat misses its mark in execution.  As in all adventure games, things start innocently (loosely applied) enough as a giant robot looking like the mobile version of HAL crossed with a lobster (I know, right?) invades your home on a derelict ship and steals your power core.  You, Horatio, from a long line of previous Horatios, must now find a way to retrieve it.  It should be mentioned that everyone in this game, including you, is a robot, and as you begin to explore the world and meet its denizens, you'll find yourself wrapped in a robot existentialist's wetware runtime environment, rolling around in what amounts to be the robotic version of a Kafka story... okay, maybe not that weighty.  There's just something about the ending (of which there are many) that just never seems satisfying, even if you take all the steps to do the 'good' one.  That being said, Primordia still manages to tell its story with care and it's delivered in perfectly-bleak dialogue for a perfectly-bleak world.

Technically, the game suffers a little bit from a few questionable design decisions.  Being (I assume) an homage to the point 'n' click (PNC) games of yesteryear, the developer insisted on a low-res, 2D game - which is great - but instead of doing what most modern games do which is make a hi-res game look low-res, this game is actually 800x600.  This isn't really that big a deal until you notice that often the character sprites don't 'belong' to the scene.  In classic adventure games, different sprites were created depending on where the character is supposed to be standing; in Primordia, the technique used instead is simply scaling down the larger sprite with the end result being a much crisper sprite on a purposely-blocky background.  Not a dealbreaker, but it can be a little bit distracting.

Other design decisions that were made are quite inexcusable in a modern PNC game.  Despite the genre being declared 'dead' for years, the truth is that the genre has thrived (loosely applied) throughout the decades and made many advances, all of which are ignored by Primordia.  For instance, in most modern PNCs, there's a hotspot-highlight button to speed along play; Primordia does not have that.  In most modern PNCs, you can usually double-click an exit to skip the slow plod of the character walking offscreen; Primordia does not have that.  To be fair, it -does- have a map system for quick travel.

Finally, there is what is known as adventure-game-logic and Primordia is rife with it.  If you're unfamiliar with the term, it is a criticism of classic adventure game puzzle solutions and how they often make little logical sense.  For example, if you needed to sharpen a pencil, logic would dictate you find a pencil sharpener, but older adventure games were known for instead making you combine a stick with a piece of glass and some tape in order to whittle the pencil... while you stand in front of a pencil sharpener.  While the puzzles in Primordia aren't quite so asinine, two extremely dense puzzles spring to mind that are just bad ideas.  Like older adventure games, you could totally sit there and work it out and feel that ego boost, but I find it hard to believe that most players won't be looking for a walkthrough when they encounter them.  That being said, most of the game is paced out well so long as you can get your head into that mindframe of the 90s and just tough it out.

All in all, Primordia is an accomplished title and a lot of love went into it, especially in the art department.  For a game entirely populated by artificial beings, there is a sort of haunting organic decay that pierces almost every piece of art in the game.  Similarly, the voice direction is quite good and despite Crispin - your sidekick floaty robot buddy - sounding a hell of a lot like Otacon from Metal Gear Solid (it doesn't fit, believe me), every one of the actors gets what the director is trying to accomplish and paints a beautiful, if desolate, piece of work.

By all accounts, I did not enjoy (but did not dislike) Primordia particularly because I found a lot of the puzzles to be purposely obtuse and the story was not one that resonated with me.  However, that does not make this a bad game and so I cannot possibly give it a thumbs down.  For some people, the story is a mindblowing, harrowing look at the nature of existence, life, its foundations, and its possible future.  It is a fascinating perspective, to be sure, but I was left unsatisfied.

Thus, if you're looking for a new PNC game, there's no reason to steer clear from this one.  What I present above are not detractions, but warnings.  PNC veterans will not bat an eye at anything that goes on in this game, but fans of modern PNC games might find a lot of things in Primordia to be frustrating.  Stick with it and it mostly rewards you - just remember that it's more about the journey than the destination in this one.",284,english
0,steam_reviews/2297180_RememberingNotrememberingSin.json,6,1,"This is a short visual novel with subpar translation... HOWEVER.
The plot is pretty damn good. It's a kafkaesque nightmare - are you guilty of something? Are others hiding something? Are you delusional? Are you sane? What the hell happened?
You are trying to find out the truth about yourself and your circumstances after an accident left you brain damaged and incapable of remembering certain things and forming new memories well. Of course, investigating anything in that state will be troubling and you will be easily manipulated and gaslit. Still, the game is pretty short and gameplay mostly focuses on correctly associating and recollecting things that happened. I think this game would be great if it was longer and had more polish in the translation department. Although the translation clearly isn't machine-based, the translator seems to make some mistakes that should be edited. Still, i do recommend playing it.

0,steam_reviews/231200_KentuckyRouteZeroPCEdition.json,3399,11,"I gotta be honest with you: There were times when Kentucky Route Zero bored me out of my fucking mind. Because while the tags claim that it is a Point & Click game and howlongtobeat says it's 7 hours long, it is way closer to a visual novel that lasted me – a usually fast reader – 13 hours. And while it is extremely beautiful and the prose great and vague in the intended lynchian/kafkaesque way, it doesn't completely distract from the fact that all you do is sit there and read, on a screen that doesn't make the process easy, in a font that refuses to do so either, with a text scrolling mechanism that hates your eyes. And the few moments of interactivity only make the fact that most of the game is picking pre-determined text options, that not even influence what is happening, but only slightly change the flavor of the scenes, more frustrating.

So, why is it still getting a recommendation from me? Well, two weeks ago, I finished Rise of the Tomb Raider and never thought about it since and have forgotten most everything about it already. Meanwhile, these past weeks playing Kentucky Route Zero, I saw my perception and stream of consciousness significantly influenced by the game, in that it allowed me to see banal moments as meaningful, made everyday interactions appear as deeply human, and wake a certain aesthetic perception that usually gets buried in the grinding routine of everyday life. I have a feeling that the game, it's moods and aesthetics – especially the transcendental-utopian scenes towards the end – will stay with me longer than most of anything. And nowadays, where video games get ever closer to perfectly exploiting your psychology to provide infinite jest, those lasting experiences are far more valuable to me.",772,english

- Interesting polygon-heavy environments interspersed with stark, often vector-looking maps and effects
- Other than that, there's not much in the way in the way of visual effects. It's a story-focused adventure  game. You know what you're getting yourself into
- The sound design is really nicely done, from the pleasant environmental background noise in the peaceful bits to unsettling scraping metal and walls of static. The game challenges your patience with the unpleasant sounds at times
- There's a lot of excellent original music. Although you're not required to, it's worth waiting around to hear the full tracks if you enjoy folk or bluegrass

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- I don't want to spoil the story, but I don't think anyone would understand what I was saying even if I tried. In broad strokes, you start off as an old man trying to make a furniture delivery. You quickly become waylaid in attempting to find your destination and begin accumulating friends
- This game requires a lot of patience. The story unfolds slowly and is heavily self-referential. Keep track of what the characters look like. It's worth it in the end
- Before you read further, understand that the rest of this section will bore you to tears if you don't read much. I studied some of this stuff half my life ago as a college student. Proceed if you like books
- The game makes heavy use of the literary technique of ""magical realism"". Although the most popular practitioner of the style is probably Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Love in the Time of Cholera; One Hundred Years of Solitude), the game's setting--Kentucky, obviously--more aptly evokes the stylings of the American South rather than South America. There are echoes of Modernists like William Faulkner in the somber, brooding scenes, but the playful, bright tones are more reminiscent of contemporary authors like Fred Chappell (I Am One of You Forever)
- Beyond the magical realism, there's a lot to dig into here for fans of Modern and Post-Modern literature. There's obvious references to the poetry of Robert Frost, and the monolithic, nonsensical bureaucracy is suspiciously Kafka-esque, but readers of Post-Modern drama will pick up on influences from grounded-in-reality playwrights like Eugene O'Niell and Arthur Miller as well as absurdists like Samuel Beckett and Tom Stoppard

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- It's an absurdist, story-based adventure game. There's not much by way of gameplay. You walk and click

- It's a very hard game to recommend. It's for a very specific audience. If you've spent a lot of time reading or studied literature at some point in your life (academically or on your own), you'll probably at least have an appreciation for what this game is trying to do
- It won't tax your system at all. I played the entirety of it on the Steam Deck, and it ran very smoothly. No bugs or crashes

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]8/10[/b]. Assigning a score for this is hard. If you have an appreciation for post-modernism and literary references, add 2 points. If you don't like those things, subtract 5. I really liked the game, but I can see how it would be polarizing even among adventure game fans",716,english

A la fin des deux premiers épisodes, j'étais tout prêt à le classer dans mes GOTY : l'ambiance sonore est parfaite, l'univers Beckeïo-Kafkaïen aussi, l'écriture réussie, les thèmes abordés (le voyage, le deuil, le capitalisme, etc.) trouvaient un écho en moi et le soupçon de fantastique était juste ce qu'il fallait pour lier le tout de façon réussie. Certains s'amusent de ce genre ces jeux en disant, justement, que ça n'en sont pas. Je vais peut-être leur donner un peu de grain à moudre : ces premiers épisodes de [I]KR0[/I] m'ont fait ressentir quelque chose d'extrêmement proches des sensations que j'aurais eu en lisant un livre qui m'aurait captivé. Alors peut-être, finalement, que tous ces [I]VN[/I], [I]Walking-Simulators[/I] et autres jeux narratifs ne sont pas grand chose de plus que des bouquins mis en image et en son, n'empêche que jusqu'ici je n'en avais jamais vu un aussi réussi : pas seulement parce que la narration est bonne (parce que des jeux narratifs que j'ai adoré, il y en a eu quelques uns avant celui-ci) mais parce que j'ai eu l'impression d'être devant de la vraie, bonne littérature.

Malheureusement, ça s'effondre un peu par la suite. Je n'ai pas aimé du tout l'épisode 3, que j'ai trouvé long, laborieux et bien moins subtil que les précédents. On rentre vraiment dans un délire mystico-perché qui prend bien trop de place à mon goût, avec des dialogues qui ne m'ont pas passionné. Reste quelques moments de grâce tout de même avec l'apparition de nouveaux personnages sympathiques. J'ai malgré tout du me faire violence pour le terminer et même si, pour moi, les épisodes suivants rattrapent un peu le tout (sans le faire avec autant de talent que les deux premiers actes), le mal était fait et j'ai plutôt continué pour voir la fin que parce que je profitais du voyage.

Or, le voyage, c'est tout de même l'un des thèmes centraux de [I]KR0[/I]. C'est d'ailleurs ce que vient rappeler l'acte IV dans lequel il se passe finalement peu de choses marquantes (enfin tout de même une ou deux, importantes pour la suite). Une sorte de retour aux sources : on vogue tranquillement d'une histoire à une autre, perdus dans un espace hors du temps. Il manque à cet avant-dernier acte un fil directeur pour que le tout se tienne, pour rattacher tous les petits évènements qu'on va croiser à l'histoire qu'on est en train de vivre, mais on revenait déjà à quelque chose qui me plaisait plus. Je suis quand même déçu par le gros évènement de cet acte IV, qu'on pouvait prévoir depuis un moment mais qui arrive tout de même trop brusquement à mon goût. J'aurais aimé avoir plus de temps pour le digérer...

Le dernier acte est un peu particulier : les décors sont magnifiques mais on perd l'aspect théâtral (chaque épisode correspondait jusqu'ici à un acte divisé en plusieurs scènes) puisqu'on évolue tout du long au même endroit. C'est peut-être une façon de forcer le joueur à prendre un peu de distance par rapport à l'aventure alors qu'on approche de la fin, mais ça a moins marché sur moi que ce qui était fait lors des épisodes précédents. C'est une fin très ouverte qui me convient mais qui n'a pas la force du début.

En bref, j'étais parti en croyant être devant un chef d'oeuvre et je suis redescendu un peu de mon nuage au fur et à mesure que je jouais. [I]Kentucky Route 0[/I] reste toutefois un très bon jeu que je recommande.",348,french

You can name your dog in the beginning, but after that it feels like nothing you do or say really matters. The minimal interaction feels like a chore. That being said there really is no gameplay to review, so let's look at some other stuff.

The story seems to go nowhere. You are looking for a place and asking people how to find it. They talk a lot, don't make much sense and send you to detours. It's not very gripping at all. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a big reveal that everything was in your mind all along. And everything is soooooo sloooooooooooooooow. To add insult to injury your player character hurts his leg and starts limping making everything even slower. Seriously. After that it sends you to a Kafka-inspired bureaucratic office to search for some papers. Fun, right? After a few trips up and down an office elevator I quit. This is the game-equivalent of data entry. But there is no pay. No reward. Zero opportunity.

The one good thing is that the graphics look nice at times. This is undermined by some of the most pretentious dark bits I have ever seen anywhere. Sometimes there's only text boxes, which might even be a design choice, because all this games seems to want is to disappoint and waste your time.

The Raven - Legacy of a Master Thief is a beautiful point-and-click adventure narrat much like a crime novel. I like that bit of meta narration as the chase of the Raven is compared to a crime novel by characters in the game - without actually breaking the 4th wall.
The game is divided into three chapters each concluded with a mayor revelation[spoiler] and introducing another playable character[/spoiler]. By my estimate the first chapter is the longest and subjectively most likeable, though I still enjoyed the other two as well.
The first chapter started with a tranquility rare to adventures and generally provided a feel-good atmosphere by transporting the joy of a luxurious train ride with careful lighting and well voice-acted, immediately believable characters only gradually giving tasks to the player to fullfil and progress.
We start to control the older, not elderly, Constable Anton Jakob Zellner, overseeing the train that also carries Inspector Legrande famous for ending the Raven's previous career. Legrande doesn't want our help, so we have to convince him of our usefulness and the story starts to unravel.
As said before, the voice acting is very good and characters believable. Oddities make sense after time and characters exhibit a few nice quirks. I particularly like ""I am the god of fire."" & Zellner's reaction to getting the pills back.
The narrative has some subtle hints as to the story development[spoiler], e.g. attitude towards Ms. Mayers, Ms. Mayers calling Zellner a constable, Zellner having the Swiss Army knife around when bound[/spoiler].
After each chapter you are evaluated. You collect points by progressing in the game or finding secrets and lose points for calling on hints.

There are good things and a few problems with game mechanics and their and other inconsistencies.

The game crashed a few times when I alt-tabbed out of the game menu and didn't alt-tabbed back in right away.
The game offers fast-forwarding for dialogue, i.e. each left-click skips the part of dialogue currently spoken to the extent of the current subtitle. That way you can adjust communication speed to your reading speed if you want to. And subtitles are almost always spot-on. There must have been some mayor confusions about how to write Captain DiConti's name.
Communication and physiological interaction among characters is well separated, avoiding bugging out while still keeping very good flow.
One problem I found with dialogue is, you cannot access the game menu, as you would otherwise, via the ESC key or the icon on the top right of the screen.

The game seems to differentiate between views, like camera angles, of a single room (a room being a collection of views rather than strictly interior) and views of different rooms, i.e. transition between the former is seamless while the latter require loading. In case loading is required the mouse cursor transforms into a door handle. But transition between views of a single room are not hinted. You have to ""go there"" to see if another camera angle is available.
[b]Machine age bias:[/b] My machine makes loading a task no shorter than 15 seconds - in case the room wasn't loaded for a while easily twice that. This meant travelling between rooms far apart was somewhat unnerving for me and I actually started doing other stuff while loading. This also led to me letting the game run when I got distracted by whatever other thing I started. Now I have to guess the actual length of the game since it is too long to simply play through again - which I surely will do in time. So I'd guess the game takes between 15 and 25 hours.

Apropos transition, there is a single puzzle ([spoiler]door to the museum's attic[/spoiler]) in the game which is missing any door-handle icon area. You may only leave the puzzle screen by solving it or pressing escape - a strange decision for an otherwise completely mouse-driven game.
That puzzle may also introduce a continuity error. You're supposed to get a translation for an inscription in order to solve the puzzle. If you brute-force the mere 512 combinations the game assumes you got the translation and evidences as much in the your journal.
When switching rooms the game mostly offers fast-travel, i.e. clicking again will skip the walking animation and directly trigger loading. This, however, doesn't work with all transistion. Usually I'd suspect in-scene triggers but I don't remember any here.
Whenever a game doesn't employ seamless loading but opts for loading times instead I'd want to have a map available to skip artificially necessary loading times of intermediate rooms. There is no game area map and no map-travel in this game, pity.

Sometimes the game cannot figure out how to walk a character from A to B, it then chooses any available walking animation and finalizes it by popping the character to where it needs to go. Walking to non-objects may result in the character endlessly walking into a wall. Interaction with an object close-by but not in direct line of sight may result in 270° turns.
The first chapter features what I'd call axe-hand and pole-hand named after two items the character is supposed to hold. Any subsequent interaction not including the axe or pole makes axe or pole merge with your hand or wrist perpendicular to your lower arm. Fortunately, this is only a glitch and the items may still be used.

I don't like the inventory dropping away right after selecting an item. It makes checking for item combination a hassle.

[b]Anachronisms:[/b]
For some reason the game is mainly English for me but some assets and textures are German like a newspaper you collect. This newspaper is peculiar in two ways. It has as running text, instead of lorem ipsum, lines from the beginning of Kafka's Metamorposis. It also seems to an Early Edition, i.e. as a July 1963 newspaper it features articles concerning 1964 events like Cleopatra's Oscar award and Surtee being a Formula 1 world champion. English version has Oct 1964 MLK Nobel peace price.
The guard room in the museum has two calendars from 1962. Possible but odd for a museum that hasn't ""spared any expenses"".
[b]The Arab:[/b] It doesn't sit well with me that the stowaway is labeled ""The Arab"" even after he has given his name. This is presumptuous and no more descriptive than ""Young Man"" would have been.
[b]Achievement hint:[/b] [spoiler]Those achievements not connected to narrative progress are usually obtained by ""fully playing out a scene"" and they may require preparation. To the best of my knowledge, they do not require right-clicks, as was stated elsewhere.[/spoiler]
[b]Soundtrack hint:[/b] In the extras, it takes some time for a song to start. Red means it is about to be played.
[b]Easter egg(?):[/b] There is a not quite hidden King Art Games hood ornament.",2339,english

Based on the original espionage thriller ""The 39 Steps"" by John Buchan, you can definitely see where modern day spy stories came from - predating popular fictional characters like James Bond by at least 30 years. This story takes place on the verge of WWI and introduces a character named Richard Hanny, a man on the run after a young American spy divulges sensitive information to him. The game is presented mostly in beautifully painted backdrops, fuzzy silhouettes and the occasional shadow puppet show (of which are quite entertaining). These backgrounds take you from inner-city London, to the moors of Scotland and back again. There isn't much gameplay to be had (to my slight disappointment), but what is present is likened to that of a game like ""TRAUMA"" - drawing shapes and clicking on things to carry through the cutscene-like chapters.

Simply put - the game is awesome for what it is - but it really needs a bit more interactivity. There is one part that involves the character decoding a notebook.

Naval Arcade is entirely unplayable, Naval RB is a broken disaster crammed with boats who's exclusive purpose is to fill space and generate grind, I've yet to meet a player that has anything good to say about Naval RB - sound bug almost guaranteed to occur every few games.
Tank RB, currently the primary game mode, has devolved into ""everybody vs America"".

The inclusion of China, as it is, is an abomination. It breaks any illusion that Gaijin ever cared. It is offensive mechanically, it is offensive historically, it is offensive politically(to both sides!) and there is next to no rhyme or reason behind the order of the tech tree.

Most people seem to think Helicopters are a mess, I couldn't say I've yet to sell a kidney on the black market and, as such, have not reached that point in any tech tree.

Having played this game since somewhere around late 2014/early 2015 I don't remember the last time I could say I've legitimately had fun with this game. The closest I've come to is a mixture of disgust and sadistic amusement at bullying the entire Wermacht with a French agricultural tractor.
Armored cars are still rendered as ""light tanks""
Pershings, Panthers and T-34s face each-other alongside PT-76s which have HEATFS projectiles(and thus can melt any vehicle) and BMP-1s which have guided anti tank missiles.

Uptiers are a game-breaking problem at and above BR 5.7 and they happen constantly. Currently, the only reliable way to grind for vehicles at higher tiers is to play 2.7 through 4.7. Experienced players can reliably max out 35-45K Silver Lions a game(that's without a premium account) bullying new players - undoubtedly as planned by Gaijin to frustrate new players into buying one of their often overpowered premiums.
But now that I've said that, watch as Gaijin nerfs the payouts for everyone.

Even the majority of WT YouTubers(those that haven't abandoned it altogether) can't be bothered to pretend they actually enjoy playing this burning landfill.
Furthermore, Gaijin will grasp at any straw they can to remove critical forum threads - even if the dubious violation in question was not committed by the original poster.

Combat is very unique and perhaps a bit wonky, but still entertaining.

I only have two criticisms overall. The game is very short, and a lot of the travelling choices are just completely random.

0,steam_reviews/238320_Outlast.json,101221,1,"Ein paar Sachen vor der eigentlichen Rezension: Ich habe Outlast für 5€ im Zuge des ""Steam Winter Sales"" für meinen neuen selbstgebauten PC gekauft, für den ich ein paar Spiele besorgen wollte. Da mir sowohl ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" von Frictional Games als auch deren vorherige Spiele, die Penumbra-Reihe, sehr gut gefielen und ich von Outlast gehört habe, dass es zu den besseren, wenn nicht den besten neueren Horrorspielen gehört, war ich neugierig. Und für 5€ kann man ja nun wirklich bei den wenigsten Spielen was sagen.

Es gibt zwei Sachen, die Outlast, in dem ein Reporter ein verlassenes Irrenhaus auskundschaftet, das von einer dubiosen Organisation offenkundig für bizarre Experimente benutzt wurde und in dem die Dinge gerade alles andere als ""rund"" laufen (mehr will und kann ich nach 2 Stunden Spielzeit nicht verraten), ausmachen: 

Zum einen seine überzeugende und morbide Atmosphäre, die dank der klug eingesetzten Spielelemente (Camcorder mit Nachsicht zum Erkunden dunkler Räume; erinnert stark an jene Flut von Found Footage - Filmen) und der stellenweise perfekt mit der Optik in eine unheimliche Symbiose fallenden Musik und Geräuschkulisse nur sehr selten an Kraft verliert. 

Zum anderen seine gezielt eingesetzten Schockeffekte (auch ""Jumpscares"" genannt), die mitunter langfristig wohl recht eintönig werden können und man sich hier und da ertappt mit sich selbst zu wetten, dass nach der nächsten Ecke oder der nächsten Tür garantiert wieder was in's Bild kommt. Nun gut, gegen derartige Formen des Horrors habe ich persönlich nichts, so lange sich ausgewogen eingesetzt werden und das Spiel neben ihnen noch andere Stärken besitzt. Outlast hat diese.

Outlast wirkt wie eine bunte Mischung vieler bekannter und etablierter Elemente des Horrorgenres. Es besitzt Szenenelemente brachialer Splatterfilme, aber auch jene von klassischen Gruselfilmen, die mit den Urängsten des Menschen hantieren (Dunkelheit, knarrende Türen, unheimliche und scheinbar nicht zu identifizierbare Geräusche). Dabei wirkt Outlast durch seine Handlung und seine Inszenierung stellenweise recht kafkaesk und das auf einem Niveau, das nicht viele Spiele erreichen. Auch das besagte Element des Camcorders als nötiges Hilfsmittel bereichert das Spiel enorm. Sehr schnell fühlt man sich, als ob man mitten in einem neuen ""Paranormal Acitvity"" stecke, bereit jene Abscheulichkeiten zu filmen, die einem bevorstehen. Dieser Spielansatz allein ist so einfach wie genial und er bereichert das Spiel enorm.

Kurzum: Die Macher von Outlast haben sich von vielen Quellen inspirieren lassen und ausihnen ein äußerst rundes Sammelsorium des Genres gebastelt, das sich sehen lassen kann. Outlast überzeugt in nahezu jeder hinsicht. Und wie gesagt: Für 5€ kann man nichts falsch machen. Es sei denn, man ist ein sehr ängstlicher Zeitgenosse und uriniert sich nach dem ersten Schock in die Hose. Dann kommen Kosten für Reinigung und eine neue Hose natürlich hinzu.",267,german
0,steam_reviews/239030_PapersPlease.json,59496,19,"This is a testament to the power of games as a medium. It manages to be, all at once, an intellectual stimulation, an escape from reality, and social commentary. It is art, entertainment and work rolled into one. As the player, you are presented with a task that is very much like a lot of paper-pushing jobs out there. Yet here it becomes an intellectual challenge; a test of your mettle and attention. And somehow it is still fun. This is quite an accomplishment in terms of gameplay.

The story, meanwhile, is at once Orwellian and Kafkaesque. It is a kind of social commentary, but not on-the-nose; it is subtle, humourous, nuanced. The recurring characters, with very brief screen time, manage to be interesting and memorable. The Soviet aesthetic is superbly done in terms of design and visuals. The UI can be annoying sometimes, but it's part of its charm and challenge.

Above all, this is a game that is [i]sui generis[/i]: its own beast. There are games with similar mechanics, but the aesthetic and the pacing make Papers, Please unique.",1354,english
0,steam_reviews/239030_PapersPlease.json,59496,19,"""Papers, Please"" est un jeu très spécial: son gameplay n'est en soi ni intéressant ni agréable, ses graphismes sont franchement déprimants, son décor reste toujours le même, il n'offre pas d'histoire à proprement parler, la plupart de ses personnages sont anonymes ou générés aléatoirement et aucun d'entre eux n'est vraiment développé, on doit y jouer sous la menace constante d'un chronomètre, notre liberté d'action y est très limitée...

Et pourtant, le jeu est une réussite puisque tout cela est maîtrisé et délibéré: ""Papers, Please"" est comme un survival horror, il propose une expérience volontairement déplaisante et oppressante afin de nous sortir de notre zone de confort et ainsi provoquer des émotions et des réflexions inédites et intenses.

Ici, l'idée n'est pas d'affronter des monstres, mais la dure réalité d'un régime autoritaire plus ou moins soviétique, le jeu pastichant l'URSS des années 1980 et en particulier la situation de Berlin divisée entre Berlin Est et Berlin Ouest: on incarne un agent de l'immigration chargé de contrôler les entrées à Grestin Est, située en Arstotzka, alors que Grestin Ouest se trouve en Koléchie, un pays voisin lui aussi autoritaire et sortant d'une longue guerre avec l'Arstotzka.

Le but principal du jeu est d'effectuer le travail que l'on nous demande, à savoir contrôler les papiers des immigrants pour ne laisser entrer que les personnes en règle, tout en gagnant suffisamment d'argent pour faire vivre notre famille: on est payé chaque jour en proportion du nombre de dossiers traités et il faut donc aller très vite, sachant que les erreurs sont punies d'une amende à partir de la troisième dans la même journée. Dans ces conditions, il est vraiment difficile de payer le loyer, le chauffage et la nourriture tous les soirs et ainsi faire en sorte que notre famille reste en bonne santé.

Évidemment, plus on avance dans le jeu, plus les règles deviennent kafkaïennes, plus on a de papiers à traiter, et plus la survie devient difficile. Pour se simplifier la vie, on peut alors tirer parti du second aspect du jeu: exploiter notre marge de manœuvre et choisir de NE PAS obéir aux règles, par exemple en laissant passer quelqu'un contre de l'argent, ou en acceptant les liasses de billets offertes par les gardes pour envoyer le maximum de gens en détention (les gardes touchent à chaque fois une prime), etc.

À l'inverse, on pourra faire preuve de grandeur d'âme et laisser passer gratuitement des gens en infraction dont l'histoire nous aura particulièrement ému (quitte à être par conséquent injuste avec les autres ou à laisser passer un bonimenteur), bloquer des criminels pourtant en règle, aider une organisation secrète à renverser le régime (mais qui sont-ils), etc.
Tous ces choix sont moins évidents et moins tranchés qu'ils en ont l'air, pouvant influencer la fin du jeu (vingt fins disponibles) ainsi que l'obtention de divers succès.

Malgré sa sobriété (ou grâce à celle-ci), ""Papers, Please"" nous confronte ainsi à des situations très intéressantes, toutes plausibles, profondément humaines et jamais manichéennes, qui nous interrogent sur la compromission dans un régime totalitaire (et ailleurs), montrant qu'un jeu vidéo peut être autre chose qu'un produit servant à passer un bon moment.",3091,french
0,steam_reviews/239030_PapersPlease.json,59496,19,"A great exercise how to make a fun game from a basic premise with low-fi graphics. The gameplay is actually enjoyable and suitably challenging with the ever-evolving ruleset. There is at least replay value for a second run-through of the campaign of about 6 hours.

The world is simple, yet immersive. It's easy to find yourself attached to a son you never even get to see. The ingame geopolitics have a surprising amount of coherence and depth, given that you just get snippets of history from newspaper headlines and conversations. Most entrants you process are just numbers, but a not insignificant amount comes with unique personalities.

The moral implications of your in-game job are most interesting. By the end of the game you get to push around absurd stacks of paper to fit the whims of a kafkaesque immigration ruleset. And yet each individual rule somewhat makes perfect sense. These are dire times, there are frequent terrorist attacks, there are subversive elements from within, there is rampant drug and weapon smuggling. It's actually completely sensible for a government to crack down in this situation. And yet there are individual tales of hardship, hope and love as people yearn to escape, find a better life or be reunited with their loved ones. There are no easy answers and the game does not dumb down this dilemma.

And then you find yourself thinking, ""I could deny the entrant, stamp a reason and hand them back their 4 documents one-by-one - or I could just press the 'detain' button and have all my problems go away with a single click"". In that moment you realize the banality of evil and how it is in each and every one of us and the game turns from a great experience to a brilliant masterpiece.",806,english

Enough is presented for an effective critique of communism, but the game seems unwilling to argue anything substantial. There’s even a mysterious organization actively fighting against it, but their politics are completely unknown and their motives seem self-serving at best.

Finding errors in the multitude of official papers is fun investigative work. But there’s not enough room in the work area to properly view all papers, so most of the frustration is moving them around and locating them piled on top of each other in a Kafkaesque monotony.

La grafica è ovviamente migliorata ma in generale apprezzabile, buona l'illuminazione ambientale; motore grafico discretamente pesante, più adatto a pc di fascia alta se si gioca al massimo delle prestazioni video.
Per tutti quelli che sperano di giocare una copia di Amnesia: The Dark Descent, vi informo che perde parecchie caratteristiche del precedente capitolo che rendevano il gioco più incentrato sul completare puzzle e fare deduzioni logiche, ma si sviluppa moltissimo sul lato filosofico e morale.
Si sente la forte mancanza di elementi che potevano rendere il gioco più godibile come horror (e/o magari difficile) come la sanità mentale, l'olio nella lampada e addirittura il menù. Tutto ciò che è perso, è in realtà sostituito ad una trama forte e profonda con svariate citazioni a Kafka e Lovecraft per esempio.
Il gameplay è basilare, non incarna per nulla il classico gioco horror: moltissimi nemici (mostri) risultano scriptati e prevedibili, quasi assente la parte esplorativa a causa di porte chiuse e labirinti volutamente lineari.
Facendo una breve riflessione su quanto detto sembra che io non abbia apprezzato il gioco, invece mi sento di consigliarlo moltissimo per via della sua trama. Quando la casa produttrice TheChiniseRoom ha sviluppato il gioco, sotto la supervisione di Frictional Games, ha incentrato tutto su una storyline profonda e inquietante poiché riteneva che il precedente Amnesia fosse quasi privo di una storia coinvolgente alla base.
Questo cambiamento non è stato apprezzato da tutti, perché ci si aspettava ben altro da un titolo del genere. Il mio consiglio è quello di giocarlo ""tutto d'un fiato"", con poche interruzioni, per poter seguire al meglio la trama e per ricordare le note che si possono trovare in giro, il tutto ""solo"" per carpire al meglio le condizioni disastrose del 1900 secondo il protagonista e l'arte che c'è dietro questo gioco.

[h1]*Recommended on sale if you have friends to play with.[/h1]

+ Refreshing concept; certainly violent, but requires lots of patience & restraint
+ Arrest & banking mechanics do well to keep one playing the game the way it was meant to be played; extra challenging in multiplayer
+ Runs on the Source engine, which never lets you down; gameplay is smooth as butter
+ Includes mechanics for human needs (toilet, food, hygiene, etc.); seems unnecessary at first, but certainly adds a bit more to the challenge
+ Delightful, vintage muzak throughout the game; reminiscient of Bioshock
+ There is only one level, though it is large & detailed

- Doors make for an awkward smack if you don't get out of the way fast enough; moderately irritating
- Single player devolves to little more than fetch/escort quests; doesn't help that the story, though Kafka-esque, is noticeably shallow
- In the event of failing a goal, it can throw one far back to the beginning of the section; often results in constant, infuriating retracing of one's steps
- Multiplayer appears to be effectively dead; there are bots, but it just isn't the same experience it should be
- Single player is painfully short; can be finished in 2-4 hours on average

“And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”

A very average game, but if your average game were very poorly optimized. Don't even try VR in this game (yes it has VR). Even if you could run it on a brand new 3090, it's total doodoo.

0,steam_reviews/24780_SimCity4DeluxeEdition.json,7752,1,"At this point, SimCity 4 is a creaky classic, but still a classic. If you're considering a citysim game you should weigh this alongside its predecessor SimCity 3000 and its figurative successor [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/255710]Cities: Skylines[/url]. If you already love the game, it's probably worth a Steam purchase if you haven't already. If you're still undecided, read on.


SimCity 4 was and still is commonly regarded as the pinnacle of its series by citysim enthusiasts. With the release of Cities: Skylines though, many of those same enthusiasts have seen that game as the new king of the genre. After a decade and change, it seems SC4's life as the only premier citybuilder is coming to an end.

However, SC4 still delivers a great citybuilding experience with enjoyable depth, graphics that still hold up well, and excellent music to listen to. Whether you should actually [i]play[/i] it depends on your affinity for the SimCity series, your attitude towards its complexity and your appetite for tinkering with the game to get it working.


SC4 is unquestionably the deepest, richest SimCity game, but for more casual players it can probably get too complicated. The game was released in 2003, and it doesn't play nice with newer computers. It's easy enough to get it running smoothly if you're technically inclined.

Custom mods truly bring the game to life, but each one has to be manually downloaded and configured. This can become annoying if not downright anal when you take into account the multiple separate dependency files that contain textures, items and other things that most mods use; a holdover from the waning days of dial-up internet...that morphed into creator pride which refused to allow the distribution of files with the mods that [i]actually used them[/i]. Also, if you don't organize your plugins folder, hunting down trouble with your plugins can be a nightmare.

If none of that sounds appealing? SimCity 3000 is older, but it's [url=https://www.gog.com/game/simcity_3000]easily available on Good Old Games[/url] and delivers the series' best balance of accessibility and challenge. Meanwhile, Cities: Skylines is easier to run, has Workshop support for mods and takes inspiration from SC4 while improving on it in certain aspects. With the release of additional expansion packs, patches and Workshop mods, its depth may come to rival and even surpass SC4's, all while still maintaining a little more accessibility. Skylines however has a large number of DLCs, whereas SC4 had only one expansion which is included in the Deluxe Edition - definitely lighter on your wallet.


It's not a totally outmoded game, either. SimCity 4 does citybuilding a bit different than Cities: Skylines; it ultimately has a bigger scope and feel than Skylines offers, which might be more appealing to some. Other than that, its primary draws at this point are it's complexity if you're into that, the pedigree of its series, and its region play. If you already know you don't like SC4's region play I guess that won't matter to you.

Skylines gives you the option of purchasing more land to make into new districts, and the amount of land can be increased with mods. SC4 though gives you entire geographical regions of varying sizes to build multiple interconnected cities on, not to mention the capacity to download others' or make your own.

Region play is fascinating and very in-depth, which enhances the depth of the actual citybuilding. Unfortunately, there's no option to build a singular city by itself like in Skylines or previous SimCity titles, and you pretty much need to start other cities to have them grow past a certain point.

There are a couple things SC4 lacks, though. It lacks truly curved roads like in Skylines, and it doesn't have a lot of focus on walkability (an important aspect of modern urban design) without the addition of user-made mods. It also doesn't have mixed-use zoning, a sign of SimCity's roots in outmoded mid-20th century urban planning...though to be fair Skylines lacks this too, and you can always combine residential and commercial zones in any given block for something approximating it.


SC4 has over a decade's worth of custom content from its dedicated community, some of which is truly excellent & high-quality and extends the game considerably. Having a lot of mods however makes the game slower and sometimes more prone to errors, and you still need to manually download and place them in your plugins folder, so choosing and organizing them strategically is advised.

If you're into it enough, it's worth it to go to the [url=http://www.sc4devotion.com/dependencies]master dependency list on SC4Devotion[/url] and download everything there so you don't have to hunt for them when you download a mod. Even that list was last updated in 2008 though, so you still need to make sure you have what you need for a mod to work.


Ultimately, even with minimal user-made mods SimCity 4 stands tall as one of the best of its genre, having only been really surpassed in any way by Cities: Skylines some 12 years after its release. If you've never played SC4 but decided it's for you, there are a couple things you should keep in mind.

As mentioned above, the game's over 15 years old and can be somewhat unstable on newer machines. The game still chugs when running large cities. To optimize the game, I recommend the tips on [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/SimCity_4]this page[/url]. I also recommend saving your cities often in any case.

You [b]absolutely need[/b] a couple of mods to fix up the game and make it playable. The Network Addon Mod in particular unscrews the traffic algorithms so your transit network doesn't degenerate into a kafkaesque nightmare.

Surreal, kafkaesk und so morbide, dass es fast schon wieder niedlich ist. Knock-knock ist der beste Alptraum, den ich jemals gespielt hab. Ein Horrorspiel, das in jeder Beziehung einzigartig ist und dabei ohne Jumpscares oder Gemetzel auskommt. Hier geht es nicht um Action, sondern vollends um Stil und Atmosphäre.

Eigentlich kann ich es nur als Gothic Novel in Spieleform beschreiben. So eine merkwürdige Mischung aus Gregor Samsas unruhigen Träumen, einem psychotischen Märchen und etwas, das sich sonst nur Poe auf Drogen ausdenken könnte. Kurzum: Absolut brilliant.

Man muss aber dazu sagen, dass das Spielgeschehen nur langsam vorangeht und man die Regeln und Ziele erstmal selber herausfinden muss. Das ist nicht für jeden, trägt meiner Meinung nach aber zum Gesamtkonzept bei.

Alles in allem kann ich nur sagen: Dieses Spiel ist definitiv Kunst. Jedes andere Indie-Horrorspiel kann gegen das hier nur einpacken und sich im dunklen Wald verstecken.",623,german

0,steam_reviews/250600_ThePlan.json,22283,4,"The Plan isn't so much a game, as it is an interactive art installation. You play the role of the fly, whose entire life seems to be devoid of meaning, flying ceaselessly upwards towards the heavens, dodging leaves and spiders along the way. The only controls in this game are ""up,"" ""down,"" ""left,"" and ""right,"" but that's all that it needs to be.

As you play, you'll realize that this is actually an allegory, and that the fly could be any one of us people lucky (or unlucky, depending where one stands) to have the chance to exist for a brief moment. The Plan examines our fragility, our tenacity, our utter aloneness. The game is a shout into the void, showing us how an obstacle of nigh indifference to one of us (a gust of wind) may very well be the greatest hurdle someone else has ever dealt with. It reminds us to keep our perspective about us, and our ego tucked neatly in our pockets. 

One could argue that the game emphasizes the brevity and meaningness of life, and at that point we enter the still relevant debates of Camus, Kafka, Dostoyevsky and similar ilk. Which side do you stand on? Do you approach the gaping maw of it all, demoralized by your tiny stature, and allow it to rip all hope and meaning from your back? Or, do you stand with The Fly and its Plan, and believe in YOURSELF as there is no one else to believe in. Find your purpose, and BELIEVE. Trundle forwards, never wavering. Know in yourself that what you do is correct. 

The Fly has a Plan. Do you?

Deeply, Isaac is the story of the son of a broken couple, the father was violent with her mother and she just build some spiders in the roof, she decided to kill her son because ""god"" was asking her to do it... a broken family. That's not literal in fact, when your mother menace you with a knife you don't jump in this trap in the ground that just appeared somehow ; no, in the reality you die. Isaac's mother didn't, she did it on the platonic field, symbolically, you kill your son by shit talking him, destroying his image of himself, comparing him with his violent and crazy father... so the son become dissociative :

Dissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.

So, that's a critic of something deeper and someone in the staff lived that, in his dissociation he had this very game idea :

So has we go on, that's a critic of this broken capitalism we got today because he force so many to marry each others for the bad reasons, money. Money is necessary but without love that's just shit, a pretext to face fuck your so called ""useless wife"" when ever you want, and if she refuses you just slap her in the face or shoot her and psychologically destroy her the retard way. Isaac is a violent critic of this soooooooo fucked up capitalism, it's about dissociation in us inner world, and how good and evil can be what you find inside yourself, Lewis Carroll, Lovecraft, Kafka, Edgar Allan Poe... you know, all the good guys, and then they just added a lot of biblical stuff and character for the lore you will discover little by little... if you know your bible that will just be repetitions and some hum?

If you like games like Silent Hill or American McGee's Alice, chances are you will love The Cat Lady. It's one of the most atmospheric games I've played, and its uncommon graphics style and approach to Death should at least be checked out, if not admired. It's like Kafka went bloodthirsty.
The music is essential for the setting and I really enjoyed it, even though the more rocking parts did the game no good imho.The story telling as well as the character depth is outstanding in The Cat Lady, I could really bond with some of the people in the game. I feel the game missed some great opportunities, though. [spoiler]I'm kind of sad that neither Liz nor Mitzi, whom I grew to like, turned out to be Parasites. Having to kill them would have been a nice play with the players feelings.[/spoiler]
The game itself is sadly not very well coded: Every time you save you have to create a new file, there is no overwriting. Changing resolutions is not possible and I happened to accidentally skip a few important text parts a few times. Skipping spoken dialogue is not possible which drags the game out a bit and gets bothersome if you have to talk to someone for a second time or you just want to end the conversation. [spoiler]Good heavens, that phone call to the police was annoying as hell.[/spoiler] Some of the voice actors [spoiler]Especially Liz[/spoiler] blew into the microphone whilst speaking, which is also a big minus. The graphics - a mixture between pixel art and high contrast photographs - are weird at first, but once you get used to the style they really shine.
The technical deficits this game has are overshadowed a great deal by its content. I finished it in two sessions and fell in love with the rainy balcony on which Susan enjoys her coffe while she smokes as well as the melody she plays for the cats. [spoiler]I also really liked Mitzi, but in the end I accidentally killed her - what made the ending better than if I would've saved her, I feel. A happy ending would just not have fit to the game.[/spoiler]

[b]NOT FOR DOG PEOPLE.[/b]

This game tells a tale about confrontation with Death and as such it expresses views not everyone might share and is quite graphic. Murder, suicide and violence are approved agenda. If you are easily disturbed and don't like to be, don't play The Cat Lady. If you look for a perfectly coded game, don't play The Cat Lady.

0,steam_reviews/255710_CitiesSkylines.json,232371,1,"On my very first city in Green Peaks, I had no idea what road hierarchy was, as a result, I only used the first road available, the two lane road, for all my road needs. 30 minutes in I had created a thriving and peaceful low density town with some industry. By 1 hour in I accomplished by first expansion creating a ""highway"" with the two lane road into a high density city center arranged in grids. I had mass expanded and created a gigantic layout fit for a population in the tens of thousands with just two lane roads, and then zoned them all for high density. Every building city block coming to fruition was a pure dopamine hit and I needed more.

Several hours later I created a city of 100,000. Demand for everything was massive and I created a separate city district away from the suburbs and the city center just for industry. Traffic barely managed as the two lane road grids barely managed to accommodate the sheer mass of humanity. I was proud though. A massive city, a healthy populous, incredible amounts of tax income, a thriving industry.

And then everything changed when the death wave arrived.

My entire city was zoned practically simultaneously. The high density zone in particular had masses of adults of the same age, and they all aged, and died, at the same time. The streets already filled to the breaking point were suddenly flooded by hearses from every cemetery and crematory, and hospitals dispatched their ambulances to care for the sick and the dying.

The entire city gridlocked end to end, road to road, house to house. The highway leading from the city center to the industrial district had a traffic jam that lasted for literal MONTHS. Teen Cims would get in their car, travel to their factory job, get stuck for months in traffic, age into adults, arrive to find themselves unemployed as the factory shutdown from lack of workers, turn around back into the gridlocked mess of a city, grow older in the traffic, arrive home just in time to fall over and die from old age.

And the smell.

Dear God, the smell.

With the hearses unable to get to the bodies, the decaying carcasses continued to rot away. Some of the original deaths remained untouched months into the downward spiral, turning the entire city into an abattoir of human suffering on an unimaginable scale.

In such an environment and city services literally trapped within the gridlock, crime became rampant. The city was literally dying, a crime ridden mess where the smell of death and decay was present in every building. Where young men and women entered the workforce only to die with their youth consumed by the traffic jam, penniless, and sad.

My original village only added to the problem. A population in the low thousand, it had few problems, it was safe, it was wealthy, and healthy. It created its own demand for housing, commerce, and industry. In short, it was prosperous. It was thin veneer of prosperity. A masque of normality to hide the writhing morass of abstracted human nightmares.

And the simulation uncaring of the Kafkaesque eldritch abomination the city was slowly evolving into, saw only the demand for Residential, Industrial, and Commercial zones.

New immigrants arrived by the hundreds to fill the vacant lots. New industries and stores popped up like mushrooms over the old. And their demands and need to travel by the road ensured the gridlocked became permanent.

The suffering would continue by the Cims very own hands. There would be no end.

I had in effect created a dystopia.

The extent of your abilities as the roach are to move forward and back, rotate left and right (tank controls) and interact with things by pushing them or using your weight or presence. The short term goals the roach needs to achieve (puzzles) are cryptically given in the form of poetic (rhyming) riddles that are often subtly humorous; the puzzles themselves are quite challenging, possibly to the point of being frustrating for some players depending on their tolerance for or enjoyment of adventure game puzzles.

The developers and creators of the game did a very good job in realizing a very dark and ominous game in tone, atmosphere, and mood. The music is also very good and fits perfectly.

There is everything in it: visuals, sounds, musics, drawings, acting, lightning, writing, poetry, catharsis...

You can finish the game in thirty minutes, probably, but finding all there is to read, watch and learn, all left from the honest and hard working developers to the audience, would take you these ten hours.

The story is fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the world conception is marvelous, the psychology behind all the story is genius. Plus it works without any tweak on modern computers, AND you get a nice making of bonus with cool devs talking.

In other words, and for real gamers: remember Sanitarium? This game is not a point and click, but it will give you the same impact. That's right, the impact of the word: masterpiece.

Как известно, вампиры — существа древние. Образ кровососов в мифологии никогда не был привлекательным, однако популярная культура сделала свое дело, и вампиры теперь занимают место, некогда принадлежавшее благородным рыцарям и прекрасным принцам. Успех недотрилогии ""Сумерки"" и ее смехотворных экранизации способствовал росту популярности вампирской тематики. Но ничего хорошего эта внезапно пробудившаяся любовь к вампирам у 10-15 летних школьниц самим Детям Ночи не принесла: теперь устрашающе-привлекательные порождения тьмы, живые олицетворения похоти превратились в светящихся куколок из второсортных детских мультсериалов, которые так любят показывать в прайм-тайм Nickelodeon и Jetix. Сейчас немногие произведения могут позволить себе показать вампиров именно в том свете тьмы, как того заслуживают эти проклятые существа, но постепенно чаша весов склоняется в правильную сторону, и настоящих вампиров можно увидеть все чаще.

В компьютерных играх дела обстоят несколько иначе, чем в литературе и кино. В игровой среде чаще всего вампиры занимают положение злых кровососов, чье массовое истребление является главной задачей геймеров. И знаменитая «Castlevania», и титулованная «BloodRayne», и шикарная «Legacy of Kain» так или иначе занимаются тем, что шинкуют на салат либо вампиров, либо охотников за вампирами. Игр, которые предоставляли бы возможность поиграть за самих вампиров, не превращая никого при этом в фарш, наверное, всего две. Это Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption(2001) и Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines(2004). Об одной из них и пойдет сегодня речь.

В 2004 году компания «Troika Games» выпустила последнюю для себя RPG, основанную на настольной ролевой игре «Vampire: The Masquerade». Игра не окупила вложенных в нее средств, однако приобрела культовый статус как у поклонников жанра RPG, так и у любителей вампирской тематики. 
Действие игры, происходит в Мире Тьмы, который ничем не отличается от нашего мира, за небольшим исключением: в нем существуют вампиры, привидения, оборотни и другая нечисть. 

Лос-Анджелес. Одна ночь в объятиях неизвестной особы переворачивает мир Главного Героя с ног на голову. Его спутник оказался вампиром, решившим разделить свое проклятие с героем. Но Мир Тьмы существует по своим законам, которые запрещают обращать людей в вампиров без специального разрешения. Поэтому новообращенный вампир должен быть подвержен окончательной смерти вместе с со своим Сиром. Обстоятельства складываются в пользу Героя: его оставляют в живых, однако теперь он находится в услужении у Князя и должен выполнять его поручения. Теперь Герою предстоит стать частью кровавых игр за власть между разными фракциями вампиров и раскрыть тайну загадочного Анкарского саркофага. 

Как уже говорилось выше, вампирские игры предпочитают шинковать все и вся, т.е. по жанру это или классический слешер, или косящий под него боевичок. RPG же требует наличие хотя бы минимально проработанного сюжета. Хорошо проработанный и глубокий сюжет и является главным достоинством Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. Помимо основного повествования, в игре есть ряд дополнительных, не менее интересных сюжетных линий, которые не оставляют равнодушными. Практически каждый персонаж имеет свою историю. Здесь нельзя пропускать ни одного диалога: помимо того, что читать/слушать их одно удовольствие, вы рискуете просто не разобраться в ситуации, упустив много важной информации. 
Особым достоинством игры стало большое количество тонкого юмора и необычных пасхалок (вроде целой миссии, пародирующей The Shining Стэнли Кубрика или пользователя интернет-кафе с логином Josef K и паролем Kafka), что делает прохождение очень приятным.

Квесты стараются быть разнообразными и не скатываются рутинному «подай-принеси», чем грешат известные представители жанра. Игрок может либо самостоятельно, либо с помощью небольшого теста выбрать один из семи вампирских кланов, причем выбор клана способен весьма серьезно повлиять на стиль всей игры. Так, кланы Бруха и Гангрел — отличные бойцы, и через несколько часов игры и правильной прокачки, такой Сородич может вырезать всех NPS, в лучших традициях слешеров; элегантные Тореадор и аристократичные Вентру всегда сумеют договорится и уладить любой конфликт миром; чудовищам Носферату приходится постоянно прятаться и прохождение превращается в настоящий стелс. Отдельного упоминания достоин клан Малкавиан, фирменная фишка которых — безумие. Специально для этого клана были переписаны все диалоги. Теперь у игрока появилась возможность говорить с телевизором, доказывать дорожным знакам их неправоту и куча других забавных возможностей.

Стоит сказать, что звуковое оформление в игре высочайшего качества. Все, от озвучки персонажей до громкой клубной музыки и звуков дождя способствует созданию атмосферы ночного Лос-Анджелеса, где под покровом темноты вампиры играют в свои кровавые игры. 

Проходить мимо Bloodlines никак нельзя. Эта игра настоящее сокровище с кровавым оттенком, истинный клад настоящих геймеров. Игра удовлетворяет почти любые вкусы. Единственным ее минусом можно назвать сильно устаревшую графику и большое количество багов. Но первое компенсируется затягивающим сюжетом, а второе устраняется с помощью ряда патчей, которые можно найти по первому же поисковому запросу. Эта игра стоит каждой секунды потраченного на нее времени и однозначно входит как в золотую коллекцию жанра RPG, так и всех видеоигр вообще.",2347,russian

To this day I will still occasionally throw in Under a Killing Moon or The Pandora Directive and thoroughly enjoy them.  Tesla Effect will be this one playthrough.

It's a Unity game and it shows.  The amount of audio channels is limited (engine issue) and will occasionally cause some artifacting.  The graphics are worse than what a lot of indie developers are putting out these days.  The worst--and most unforgivable--part of this is on Chandler Avenue.

Chandler Avenue is the main setting for the game and at least half your playtime will be spent there.  That's fine for a Tex Murphy game, they've all been like that, but what is not fine is that their 3D artist had no concept of LOD.  The entire street has one LOD and it all seems to be loaded even if you're on the other end of the block.  This produces a ridiculous amount of frame rate loss and is rather inexcusable for a game these days.

The story was convoluted to the point where Kafka might have ghost-written it.  Characters are completely re-written and made into new mechanations that are not true to the decade, or so, of writing that made them.

A lot of the puzzles are obtuse and needlessly gimicky.

The pros:

The game still has the Tex Murphy charm which is worth the price alone.  The acting is fantastic (in it's intentionally over-the-top fashion) and it was fun to see the old characters back again even if a lot of who they are has changed.

The overall sound design stayed true to the original games.  I got giddy when I first heard ""You have a fax.""

Most importantly, the game knows what it is and is true to itself for the most part.

If you played the games from the 90s then you should be able to spend $20 on a trip through memory lane.  It's less than the cost of a movie and you will get at least a dozen hours out of it.  It won't all be great but there is enough to justify the price.",1860,english

Die Vorgeschichte

Spanien 1938, Katalonien: Am Rande der Pyrenäen steht eine herrschaftliche Villa mitten in der unberührten Natur. Ein Adler kreist majestätisch über das Bergtal, beobachtet vom fast wolkenfreien Himmel aus die Idylle. Doch es ist die Ruhe vor dem Sturm, denn wenige Minuten später tauchen wie aus dem Nichts Soldaten auf. Es sind General Francos Faschisten, die in der Villa einfallen und die Bewohner in Angst und Schrecken versetzen. Sie haben sich jenes Haus aber nicht ohne Grund ausgesucht. Die Familie ist im Besitz eines Gemäldes namens La Maledicció, das für sie einen ganz besonderen Wert hat. Denn angeblich ist jenes Gemälde verflucht und nach Meinung des Dominikaner-Ordens das reine Böse.

Seit diesem Ereignis sind viele Jahrzehnte vergangen, der Kunstraub in den 30er Jahren geriet in Vergessenheit. Nun hat La Maledicció einen neuen Besitzer – und wie der Zufall es will, ist George Stobbart für die Versicherung des Gemäldes zuständig. Über sein Wiedersehen mit der französischen Journalistin Nico Collard kann er sich aber nur kurz freuen. Denn kaum haben sich alle Gäste in der Galerie eingefunden, stürmt ein Mann mit schwarzem Motorradhelm herein – klaut erst das Gemälde und erschießt anschließend Galeriebesitzer Henri. Während George herauszufinden versucht, weshalb die Alarmanlage nicht funktioniert hat, erfährt er, dass sich ein düsteres Geheimnis um La Maledicció rankt. Der Dominikanerpriester Simeon erzählt ihm etwas vom Werk des Teufels – und von den häretischen Gnostikern. George ist nicht leichtgläubig, aber als weitere Morde geschehen, wird selbst er skeptisch…

Story

Die Geschichte von Baphomets Fluch 5 versteht sich wie schon in den Vorgängern als eine Mischung aus Kriminalgeschichte und Mystery-Abenteuer. Im Hintergrund spielen also finstere Kräfte eine Rolle, die in irgendeinem Zusammenhang mit der Kirche und speziellen, religiösen Gemeinschaften stehen. Im Vordergrund aber stehen die handfesten Ermittlungen. Zunächst suchen George und Nico, die ihr abwechselnd und, mit leichtem Überhang bei George, gleich lang steuert, nur nach dem Dieb und Mörder. Schnell erkennen sie jedoch, dass weit mehr Personen und Interessensgruppen involviert sind, und stolpern von einer Gefahr in die nächste. Das ist sehr spannend aufgebaut – wir sind schon jetzt gespannt darauf, wie es weitergeht.

Falls euch der letzte Satz wundert: Wie im Vorfeld angekündigt, erscheint Baphomets Fluch 5 in zwei Teilen, am 4. Dezember sowie im Januar. Die Handlung ist folglich mit dem ersten Teil nur zur Hälfte verfügbar. Sobald die zweite Hälfte fertig ist, wird die aktuelle Version durch das Komplettpaket ersetzt – ihr werdet für Teil 2 nicht nochmals zur Kasse gebeten.

Lustig

Das neue Abenteuer von George und Nico verzichtet bei seiner spannenden Erzählung samt chronisch verlogener Zeugen nicht auf den berühmten Humor der Serie und skurrile Charaktere. Wie üblich schaltet sich auch die an Inkompetenz kaum zu überbietende französische Polizei in Form von Inspektor Navet und seinem Gehilfen Moue ein – wobei letzterer für Serienkenner kein Unbekannter ist. Er muss von Nico erst überzeugt werden, sie in die eigentlich versiegelte Galerie zu lassen. Sie vergleicht die Geschichte seiner zwischenzeitlichen Suspendierung, die etwas mit erhöhtem Blasendruck zu tun hatte, mit einem Roman Kafkas, woraufhin Moue nur meint, sie sollte ihm jetzt nicht mit den Namen von Fußballern kommen.

Genau diese Information ist später wichtig, um Moue von seinem Posten wegzulocken, wobei auch eine CD mit Meeresrauschen hilfreich sein kann. Natürlich bedient Baphomets Fluch 5 auch wieder eine Reihe von französischen Klischees, was etwa in der ruppigen, selbstgerechten Art des Kellners in einem Pariser Café zum Ausdruck kommt. Besonders aber läuft George mit seinen saloppen Kommentaren immer wieder zu alter Hochform auf, die ihm in Baphomets Fluch 4 – Der Engel des Todes zu oft abhanden gekommen war. Erfreulich ist auch, dass diesmal wieder mehr alte Bekannte eine Rolle spielen: Unter anderem taucht mit Laine der Kunstkritiker aus dem zweiten Teil wieder auf.

Sound

Besonders gut gelungen ist einmal mehr auch die deutsche Lokalisation, die die allgemeine Stimmung und auch den Humor in Wort und Klang exzellent aus dem Original überträgt. Dass Nico dabei nicht mehr wie in sämtlichen Vorgängern von Franziska Pigulla gesprochen wird, hörten wir zwar, aber eine bessere Ersatzwahl als Petra Konradi hätte Revolution Software nicht treffen können!

George selbst wird wie immer schon von Alexander Schottky vertont. Auch in den Nebenrollen sind die Besetzungen klasse. Unser Meinung nach ist die deutsche Fassung den ebenfalls enthaltenen französischen und englischen Voiceovers sogar klar vorzuziehen, das deutsche Hauptsprecher-Duo gefällt uns jedenfalls besser. Der einzige kleine Wermutstropfen ist, dass in der deutschen Übersetzung logischerweise der starke britische Akzent der englischen Charaktere fehlt, was in den entsprechenden Spielszenen authentischer wirkt.

Gäbe es nicht bereits die Fan-Fortsetzung Baphomets Fluch 2.5, so müsste man Der Sündenfall genauso nennen. Zum einen, weil es bisher wirklich nur ein halbes Spiel ist, und zum anderen, weil es ganz so tut, als habe es die unbeliebten Teile drei und vier nie gegeben. Einerseits ist das ganz großartig, weil es sehr authentisch das Feeling und die Atmosphäre der beiden Urahnen wieder belebt.Der gute alte Mix aus Krimi, düsterem historischen Geheimnis und finsteren Verschwörern funktioniert noch immer genau so gut wie die Chemie zwischen den beiden Hauptdarstellern George und Nicole.Außerdem können Veteranen zu viele Pointen und Wendungen der Handlung auch drei Meilen gegen den Wind riechen. Was bleibt ist die Hoffnung auf die zweite Spielhälfte: Gut, an der Technik wird sich wohl nicht mehr sehr viel tun, aber beim Anspruch und der Entfaltung der düsteren Verschwörung ist noch Luft nach oben.

Zum Abschluss kann man sagen, dass Baphomets Fluch 5: Der Sündenfall für Fans der Serie und von Point & Click Adventure Fans ein muss ist.

0,steam_reviews/263680_UnearthedTrailofIbnBattuta-Episode1-GoldEdition.json,811,1,"Many people would try to tell you that Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta is a poor man's Uncharted, when it's clearly the other way around. My friend and I discovered after playing through the whole game that what we have here is clearly the better experience. For example:

Uncharted had Nolan North. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004220434/screenshot/469798213432202374]Unearthed has Troy Baker.[/url] Which one of these voice actors won GOTY last year? That's what I thought.

[b]Unearthed: 1 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Unearthed runs at 60 FPS at 1080p. Uncharted only runs at 720p at 30 FPS. Basic math tells us that since the frame buffer has roughly 4 times as many pixels and twice as many frames, Unearthed is at least 8 times better looking than Uncharted.

[b]Unearthed: 9 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Uncharted 3 had horses. Unearthed has 4 wheel ATVs. That's 4 more wheels than Uncharted lets you ride.

[b]Unearthed: 13 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Uncharted only runs on the PS3, while Unearthed runs on Android, PC, Mac, and probably the Gizmondo.

[b]Unearthed: 17 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Uncharted only has creepy slippery Nazis. Unearthed has full on zombies, and it doesn't need to explain why they're there.

[b]Unearthed: 18 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Uncharted usually only gives you a few weapons to choose from at any time. Unearthed has more weapon types than there are enemies in the entire campaign.

[b]Unearthed: 19 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Nathan Drake is a pussy who gets scared and emotional when the going gets tough. Faris Jawad doesn't stop cracking jokes even when a gun is fired at his sister.

[b]Unearthed: 20 Uncharted: 0[/b]

Finally, as Unearthed rightfully points out on the store page, this game has been translated into more languages than most best-selling literature will ever see, because Semaphore knows everyone will want to play this and wants to be culturally sensitive to everyone. Uncharted consists of playing a white guy shooting minorities. I think we know who is more socially responsible.

[b]Unearthed: 41 Uncharted: Racism[/b]

[b]Winner: Unearthed[/b]

This is just a summary of all the things that make Unearthed the best. I didn't even go into detail about the leisurely strolls through the city discussing the plot, or the Kafka-esque analysis of the futility of escaping in a car as the city loops around you. There's just too much to this game to pack in one review, and I implore you to check out what may already be the de-facto GOTY of 2014.",78,english
0,steam_reviews/265690_NaissanceE.json,2999,4,"Absolutely amazing game. For me, an easy 9.9/10 (minus 0.1 [spoiler] for the extremely annoying white or black rooms with flickering lights at the end of the game where I almost lost my sight[/spoiler]). What sold it to me at first was the bit about exploring super massive structures...And waow I was not disappointed. I had never played a game like this ever before. In fact it was quite an experience at times. The really bizarre feeling of wandering among huge abandoned structures was really something. It's like living in a Kafka's novel. Plus the soundtrack (unfortunately not available) is very very good. Fits perfectly the game. A great bunch of alternative/indie artists !

Aside from the stunning visuals, the breath-taking scale of the secretive megastructure, the suspenseful pacing and kafkaesque atmosphere of the play between light and darkness ... I feel the need to point to the beautiful and enriching sound-design of the experience.
Otherworldly soundscapes scratch, brood and stretch behind the walls. Creepily chattering mechanisms click, whirr and hum in their spaces. Strange ambient noises fluctuating just on the brink of perception eventually become something else (I swear I heard pigeons at one point)... awe-inspiring.
And then there's the music. An assortment of deep drones, sci-fi winds and strings, and distorted synthesizers serve to capture the scenic moments of tranquil exploration and promote a pounding involvement when the pace picks up and the breathing of player and character sync up. 

As a fan of Blame!, by Tsutomu Nihei, I've been waiting for this game.

It is surreal, intimidating, engaging, awe-inspiring and all-throughout an atmospheric exploration game worthy of the sub-genre name. 
If this game doesn't sell you on the idea that video games can be art, I wouldn't know what could.

Addendum: Not for the seekers of casual trial-and-error puzzles. Brain involvement is required. Might also, at times, be very frustrating.
I'll use a quote from wsgf.org to explain why: 
""No weapon, no flashlight, no idea where you are. NaissanceE is a first-person exploration game set inside a soulless architectural complex. Puzzles involve simple platforming mechanics and a clever use of light sources [a.o.]. Trough eerily lit corridors, across bright gigantic halls, up and down stairs and on the edge of endless chasms, Lucy must find her way to freedom... and safety.""",2025,english

Ohne viel Erklärung finden wir uns in einem schwarz-weissen Raum wieder, aus dem wir anscheinend entkommen wollen. Man sieht streckenweise wirklich nicht viel. Der Kontrast ist extrem. Lichter mit absolut harten Schatten irritieren. Wo es weitergeht kann man oft nur erahnen oder ausprobieren. Manchmal landet man auch in einer Sackgasse und muss woanders weitersuchen. Manchmal irrt man durch Räumlichkeiten und findet keinen Ausweg. Man geht dann auch schon mal irrtümlich den Weg zurück, den man hergekommen ist, weil alles sich so ähnlich ist oder um zu sehen, ob man etwas übersehen hat. Oder man springt einfach mal blind irgendwohin.

Daneben oder zusätzlich gibt es noch Jump&Run-Einlagen, die nicht einfach sind. Stirbt man, kann man den Abschnitt wie üblich wiederholen.

Weitere ""Tricks"" sind, dass eine Wand nicht unbedingt eine Wand bleiben muss, man also auf ganz ungewohnte Weise weiterkommen kann, was aber oft nicht klar ist. Bei so einer Stelle habe ich es dann auch aufgegeben.

Das Ganze kommt so bedrückend, in gewisser Weise eintönig, daher, und das Weiterkommen ist so schwer und wenig ermunternd, dass ich zudem die Freude an dem Spiel sehr schnell verlor.

Immerhin: spätere Bereiche sahen (in einem Let's Play) sogar etwas interessant aus. Etwas. Aber soweit muss man sich erst mal durchquälen. 

Manche sagen, das Spiel nimmt einen nicht bei der Hand und es ist ihm (oder den Entwicklern) egal, ob es einem Spaß macht. Und daher ist es gut. Hm. OK. Wenn man das mag. Für meinen Geschmack hat es das Spiel hier aber sowas von übertrieben damit.

0,steam_reviews/26800_Braid.json,9010,1,"Everyone seems to think Braid is just another 2d puzzle platformer with artful visuals and cryptic narrative, and they are right. However there is a reason I put this on my favorite games ever category and leagues ahead of say limbo. One, it is hard. I like hard. I like it when a puzzle game stumps me to the point where I have to come back weeks or months later. Some of the puzzles in Braid are so well crafted that you will feel like a goddamn prodigy everytime you complete them. So yea if you are an idiot don't play this because you don't have what it takes. The atmosphere brough about from the lush oil paint styled visuals and the simple but rich plucking string tracks is hard to really pin. I guess I would liken it to reading a damn good book and the feeling you get while reading your favorite part. As for the story, you don't HAVE to get it to still enjoy and appreciate this game. Which is good because the story is so cryptic, Franz Kafka would approve. Still if you are smart enough to beat the game you probably have enough understanding of the world and literature to read what is really being conveyed and let me just say when you realize just what the message is, so many other aspects of the game just become that much more impressive in how artfully crafted they were. Also the ending earns a spot in my ""favorite sequences in gaming"" list as well as favorite endings.

0,steam_reviews/270170_DepressionQuest.json,3828,1,"I'm starting with the bad: There are a lot of things I felt like could have been done better, the biggest being getting through to the player why the ""good"" choices are crossed out, because from reading the reviews I feel like a lot of people missed the point. Guys: They're crossed out because of course you're thinking of those options and of course so would someone with depression, but that doesn't mean that you can actually execute those tasks when you're in the throes of it.

Also, yes, nothing particularly bad happens to the character, but that's the whole point: depression doesn't have an external cause, just external stimuli that make it worse. In that sense, this is in many ways a solid depiction of depression. It manifests in different way to different people but this is part of why it's so demoralizing and frustrating--you feel like you've had your toenails pulled out one by one when none of what you're dealing with should be that difficult, objectively.

While some people have said this should just be a novel or a story, the interactive part of this is critical--the choices you can't make are as important as the ones you can, and the feeling of relative futility equally so.

And the stated objective here is to try to communicate this experience to people who haven't been through it, to help people who want to understand just a bit more what this is like to live with. As someone who's fought depression his entire adult life, any effort to that end is an admirable in my mind, especially given how many times I (and many others) have struggled with having the depression conversation with loved ones. It's not Kafka, it's not David Foster Wallace, but so fucking what. It's a helpful addition to a conversation many of us have struggled with, imo, and I'm grateful someone took on the task.",31,english
0,steam_reviews/271590_GrandTheftAutoV.json,1315614,1,"BEWARE.

The game has lots of opportunities for fun. There are lots of things to do and many ways to pass the hours while you are cooped up inside. It can also cause immense suffering.

PROBLEMS WITH STORY MODE: 
- The writing is juvenile and crass. The satirical critique of ""Isn't America so violent and stupid and sexist?? XD"" are valid but then the game tries to have its cake and eat it, too, by indulging in many of the things it critiques.
- The lack of auto-save is annoying, sometimes to devastating effect.

PROBLEMS WITH ONLINE:
Hoo boy. This is the big one.
- Structurally, the main problem is that Rockstar has figured out how to keep you playing and keep you wanting to earn money, and they've given a possible shortcut by offering 'shark cards' (pay real money to get in-game money) to players. ""Fine,"" you say, ""I'm not going to give in to weakness and buy those cards."" That's good for you, but it gives R* a perverse incentive to only fix bugs that get in the way of selling more cards, and leaving bugs in place if they keep players frustrated and likelier to pay to skip the hassle of making cash.
- Devastating bugs persist. Example: you can pick up a bunch of crates, 3 at a time, and then sell them in bulk (like up to 111). The final delivery mission can bug out, prevent you from releasing your cargo, causing you to fail and lose all of the crates. If you record this / report it promptly, R* support can compensate you, but it sucks to have it happen.
- Kafkaesque bugs persist. Ex: side mission to collect 100 action figures scattered across the map. The last two only spawn after you get the first 98. Many, many people report the 98th disappearing and being nowhere to be found even after triple-checking all locations. Just contact Rockstar Support and they'll help fix it for your account, but it still sucks.
- You must, must, must learn how to do port-blocking to make a solo public session. Google that. 
- R* seemingly does nothing about the legions of modders who are running around in god mode ruining things for other people. You just need to change servers when one of these people show up in the game.
- R* has added enough super-weaponry over a long enough time that new players have to contend with trying to scrape together their earnings while jets and rocket-powered motorcycles with homing missiles rain death down from above them constantly. Lots of other players are very bad sports and R* has not yet figured out how to fix this.
- The work-like nature makes grinding turn into something that you want spreadsheets to track, so it becomes like a job
- The casino is literally a casino. Luckily the odds for the horse-racing game are broken and you can actually beat the house with it, google that.
- Cayo Perico heist has made all other ways of making money irrelevant (except for keeping things varied and interesting). Just buy a submarine ASAP. Pavel is my boyfriend now. He can be yours, too.",42788,english
0,steam_reviews/272270_TormentTidesofNumenera.json,4028,1,"经过三周目的体验达到全成就之后，我对本作有了些许改观，总的来说，本作继承了PST对游戏世界的细致刻画，虽然效果并不是那么好。此外，如果不是游戏最后对主要冲突的解决过于儿戏的话，剧情本来是可以很丰富的，游戏里的两大主要区域Sagus Cliffs和The Bloom的内容其实并不少，但是绝大部分都是支线内容，这很明显是在一开始设计任务路线的时候就出了问题。私以为盲目地将本作搞成全平台发售的公司高层绝对是脑子有病，因为照顾主机平台的手柄操作，本作的战斗系统彻底成了噩梦，将绝大部分喜欢RPG战斗元素的玩家排除在了目标群体之外，属实作茧自缚。

本来20年前玩过PST的玩家都快要从黑发变成白发了，凭兴趣去玩年龄和自己接近的游戏的年轻玩家是少之又少，搞不清目标群体的需求造成经费没有用到刀刃上，最终将本作弄成了PST的一个拙劣继承者，白费了Numenera这么一个非常有意思的背景设定。反而从纯粹的文学和TRPG角度制作的Disco Elysium被媒体宣传为PST的精神续作，实在是造化弄人。


下面是原来的一周目评测
——————————————分割线——————————————

作为众筹金额创纪录的PST”精神”续作而言，有点名不副实，更确切的说是虎头蛇尾。从游戏流程的设计上能看出本作和PST有着非常多的相似点，但是细细对照起来却发现很多地方经不起推敲。

下面我具体解释一下TTON的失败之处，单纯走主线的话TTON的游戏时间可能10小时都不到，这对一个CRPG游戏来说是个巨大的灾难。因为本作继承了PST的游玩风格，全程基本可以对话推进，导致没有任何障碍阻止玩家直奔主题，虽然本作的目标群体都是探索支线为主的，但是主线的单薄注定这个游戏是个失败之作。就拿前辈PST来做个对比，Sagus Cliffs对应Sigil，Miel Avest对应Ravel’s Maze, The Bloom对应The Curst，然后游戏在The Bloom之后戛然而止，导致玩家觉得终于可以放开手脚大干一场的时候突然游戏就结束了，可以说两者后期都有缩水赶工的情况。更为遗憾的是，PST在后期赶工的情况下仍然完成了对 “What can change the nature of a man?” 的解答，而TTON却并没有解答 “What does one life matter?”这一剧情的核心问题。剧情的最后Last castoff和The Sorrow对质时，讨论的问题甚至可以说和核心问题没有关系，这让我感到无所适从，甚至有点生气。仔细一想，改变人的本性和生命的意义何在确实在问题的重量级上不一样，不过中国有句古话说得好，没有金刚钻，不揽瓷器活。既然制作组选择抛出这种问题，就应该想好怎样从各种角度诠释问题的答案，而不是到了故事的最后丢下问题草草了事，虽然在很多支线过程中能体会到不同的角色对生命的态度，但是问题在于玩家选择的并不是对核心问题的解答。此外，PST中的派系多并且设定合理，TTON中绝大多数派系都是The Changing God创造的，这让人非常的无语，并且TTON的支线看起来也没有PST多，从各种角度来说，TTON都没有达到PST的水平，实在是担不起精神续作之名。

和同为众筹的永恒之柱1相比，TTON如同一个半成品，我不知道Inxile讨饭组是怎么花这个钱的，引擎用的是柱子的，筹的钱比柱子多，最后却得到这种结果。众筹时我还在上大学，没能力出大钱，现在想来没有希望就没有失望，除了无能狂怒喷喷Inxile还能咋办。

最后的最后，对于喜欢文本丰富剧情有深度的这类游戏的玩家来说，TTON还算可以，抛开那时常出现的故弄玄虚的行文风格的话，纯看文本个人认为能打70分，和PST以及最近的Disco Elysium比还是强人所难，不过想来这种看原文的游戏也不会引起多大波澜，毕竟文学才是追求文本丰富剧情有深度的最终归宿。既然如此，去看看James Joyce, Marcel Proust或者Franz Kafka也许是个不错的主意。",4633,schinese
0,steam_reviews/274170_HotlineMiami2WrongNumber.json,48896,1,"As brutal and more expansive than its predecessor, Hotline Miami 2 will keep you pushing through its difficult levels by using its fantastic soundtrack and unique story to make you hit ""R"" one more time. The maps are much larger than those experienced in the first title. This increases the difficulty, but also results in many cheap deaths from an armed enemy way out of your vision's range. Don't expect to go melee crazy on these maps, either. Not only are ranged opponents plentiful, but the large range of sight and constant glass windows mean that you can be taken out from almost anywhere. Expect more methodical gameplay from this one.  

As for the story, very few games on the market approach what one could call ""Kafkaesque"" in narrative, most likely because no AAA game in its right mind would choose to go a route so different to most audiences); however, Hotline Miami 2 certainly isn't shy in shattering expectations. The game does everything that an indie title should do: go where AAA titles won't. By this, I don't mean Hotline Miami 2's ridiculous levels of violence, but the narrative flow of the game is extremely scattered, challenging the player to piece it together instead of simply handing over its plot like a made-for-TV movie. It also forces the player to work through a variety of characters, often taking actions that make us feel uncomfortable. For the most part, Evan is the only palate cleanser throughout the game's brutality and moral trauma.

Watch this tutorial to get an idea of what you're getting yourself in for. There are currently 46 of these, totalling more than 4 hours runtime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SDgi6PXfYg

Leaving the rest below as context for the dev's response.

[b] Edit 1: [/b]Wow - see (extensive!) response from dev below.

It does look like I missed a couple of things that could have made my life easier, especially the dynamic stock and buyer/demographic reports. And I completely missed the wiki, which looks very useful. I'm less convinced about the vehicle design system - I did indeed use those tutorials and still don't really know what I'm doing! And the sports car/Mpg was a bad example but the point stands I think.

I'm going to go back and give it another bash with these tips in hand, and may well come back and change this review to positive.

Also worth noting that this seems to be typical of this dev - very attentive to the community, open about the game's flaws, and working hard to help players get the most out of it.

Eric, if you read this, thanks for such a detailed and helpful response. Sorry to hear there won't be a sequel but I will definitely look out for Aeromogul! All the best.


[b] Original review: [/b]
A negative review, but I did enjoy most of my time with this game, and it certainly has a lot going for it. If they ever make a more polished sequel I'll buy it in a second. If you don't mind taking a bit of a punt with £16 and in-depth management games are your thing, it might be worth a try.

I have no problem at all with the look of the game - it's very nostalgic for anyone who pines for the classic 90s management sims, and that includes me, so I'd say it's a plus. I also didn't think the game was overly complicated or inaccessible. There are ample tutorials inside and outside the game , and of course the complexity and depth is the main selling point of the game so anyone expecting a quick & easy management-lite game is obviously in the wrong place.

The main problem by far is the UI - it's just not good enough. There is some basic stuff - the sliders and dropdowns are janky, for example - but it 's the overall layout of the menus and systems that's the real killer. Navigating between all the different screens is incredibly (and unnecessarily) laborious, with most decisions seeming to require you to collate information from several different areas across the UI, meaning you will be needing either screenshots, notepad or a very good working memory, and definitely a whole lot of patience. A good example is the stock trading system: interested in buying a company's stock and want to know more about them? The stock screen itself will tell you their quarterly revenues and market cap but that's about it. Another screen, three clicks away, will let you look up their last year's profits and cash reserves. If you want to know what their lineup and production costs look like, that's another five or six clicks away in a completely different part of the UI. And if you actually want to know how much those models retail for and where, I hope you have plenty of time and like playing 'guess the city' on a clunky and slow-scrolling map.

The car design system is the above times ten. Trying to design a marketable car is a kafkaesque menu hell. Unless you're already familiar with the minutae of car performance across markets in the 1900s (or whenever you start), you're going to want to know what counts as a reasonable Mpg for a sports car, or what the market size is, or what people typically pay. Some of that information can be painstakingly pieced together by navigating across all the different menus lamented above (and your car/parts design screen resets every time, so be ready to reselect those design settings many, many times over - hope you remember the slider positions!). Other information doesn't seem to be available at all: the game gives target demographics for each car model, for example - e.g. 35-55, middle income, female (bit mysterious for a pickup truck in 1910s Europe but let's roll with it) - but what you're supposed to compare that to is a complete mystery. I couldn't find any reference to these variables anywhere else in the game, let alone the kind of demographic or economic breakdown by country/region that would allow to make meaningful use of them.

What finally did for me - and this is always a challenge for business sims, and strategy games in general, to be fair - was the transition from early to mid-game. After heroically struggling over the above hurdles, paying off my initial debt, getting a few sellable cars on the market and building a decent stock portfolio, it was time to plan my expansion into a third regional market - and I just couldn't face the work. The hard, exciting part is over, and now you have nothing to look forward to but repeating the same process over and over again, with increasing complexity but less challenge, and no additional elements of strategy or gameplay.

Dev: Please do make a sequel, and get some help with the UI design process. There's at least another £16 coming your way if you do.",4345,english
0,steam_reviews/2870_XRebirth.json,7225,1,"Au bout d'un an de patches (!), le jeu est plutôt jouable, stable mais encore buggué quoique qu'on ne sache pas si c'est en raison des mécaniques de jeu périmenazes et absconses ou simplement de purs vrais bugs résultant de l'incompétence notioire d'Egosoft qui fait pourtant le même simulateur spatial pourri depuis des années. Les deux sans doute. L'interface au pad 360 est bizarre mais presque correcte tout comme les menus à  la fois laids et peu pratiques. En vérité, rien n'est vraiment ""pratique"" dans un X, tout est pensé en dépit du bon sens. Le commerce est incroyablement lourd à gérer, même l'exploitation minière est un pensum. Les combats sont moyens, on est loin des vieux standards de référence (des années 90 !) en la matière !

0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"[h1] 一、劇情:[/h1] 
本作發生的時間介於bio5和bio6之間，並延續bio5和啟示1的劇情。

Claire Redfield(Chris的妹妹)和Moira Burton(Barry的大女兒)等Terra Save成員被[spoiler] Terra Save當時的領導人-Neil出賣給Alex Wesker。[/spoiler]
並由Alex的手下俘擄至某一講俄語的孤島，並強制注射了T-Phobos(恐懼) Virus，以尋找適合Alex Wesker使用的容器(大蛇丸上身??)
在Claire篇最後，Alex發現Natalia Korda才是她最完美的容器後自盡，同時啟動實驗室自毀程序，在最後的逃亡中，Claire不得已棄Moira跳崖逃生並幸運獲救。
6個月後，Barry Burton才終於透過fucking technology找到孤島的位置，並為尋找Moira而踏上了""亡靈""之島。
而Moira的生死及Alex是否順利於Natalia體內蛻變(Metamorphosis)，則由玩家在Claire篇chap3的選擇而定。
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=862318862

啟示系列一向比正篇重氣氛(尤其是和完全動作的5、6代相比)，而本作也不例外，同時和比bio4之後的系列作(尚未玩bio7，暫無法評論)還多了不少解謎成份。
也一向引用世界名作的句子(啟示1係但丁-神曲; 啟示2則以卡夫卡的變形記為主)
此外，這一代的劇情、對話和文件，充分顯現角色的個性，次主角Moira的個性尤其鮮明動不動出口成髒，還被葉夫根尼大叔唸""Wash your mouth out with soap""

本作與歷代的連結感非常夠，由Natalia滅門事件和Neil原本效忠的FBC帶出啟示1的浮島事件(Terragrigia Panic)。
Claire篇Claire和Moira在地下牢房餐廳所聽到的俄文廣播，據說就是在講""惡靈古堡CG電影-詛咒(Damnation)""時期發生的東斯拉夫共和國的政變及生化恐怖攻擊。
另外裡面的各種文件更是補完了不少5代中Jill獲救後的故事、甚至於Claire還被Chris的隊友誤為是和哥哥一樣肌肉很大的戶愚呂妹
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867272347

而最重要的是Wesker Project的後續，本作的大反派Alex Wesker是Wesker Project自Albert Wesker死後最後的倖存者，
她也繼承Spencer(曾她視為父親?)和Albert(被她視為哥哥)的遺志(狂想)，以成為神而努力。
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867272301

在閱讀卡夫卡相關作品-變形記等[註一]及他的人生後，Alex認為透過逃脫(escape)舊有肉體，意志永存，無限轉生在新的肉體，她將可以成為神!!!

註一: 
本作受法蘭茲.卡夫卡(Franz Kafka)所著的<<變形記(Die Verwandlung，又譯蛻變)>>影響頗深，
不少劇情、台詞也和<<變形記>>有關。[ex: ""I am supposed to be Grete. Not you!""(我才是格蕾塔，才不是妳這小屁孩)]
變形記主要講述一個為家出外打拚的阿宅-Gregor，但一天莫名變成了成蟲，沒有辦法出去工作。原本倚賴他的家人只好出去打拚，包括他原本有機會進入藝術學院的妹妹Grete。
後來因為Gregor擅自跑出來，嚇跑了在他們家租屋的房客，讓他爸爸大怒，憤而丟蘋果，那個蘋果剛好卡在Gregor的背上，後來就傷口發炎留癑而死。
而他曾經愛的家人則很開心，他這人終於死了，他們可以快樂的過新生活~~

註二: 卡夫卡的小說到死後才比較有名，可能是因為這樣。Alex才認為雖然卡夫卡肉身已死，但他的小說卻流芳於後世，意志永存才是最重要的。(另外她可能還看了naruto~誤很大)

[h1] 二、操作: [/h1]
操作性比啟示1好很多(啟示1可能是因為移植3DS掌機，很多操作會卡卡的)
也可以額外功能昇級主角和副主角的skill。(但千萬小心，某些技能不能升太高，否則像""尖端""獎盃就很難破，因為會不小心使用體技)

另外，本作也是一款雙人遊戲(但pc版劇情模式只有電腦ai，無法和pc玩家co-op模式[註三])，
這代電腦AI也不算高，慶幸的是可以透過「主角和副主角的來回切換」或是「昇級skill改善AI智商」(但倒數模式和隱形模式貌似會變笨回來，常常不會主動閃躲敵人、補血或補刀。)
透過主角和副主角的來回切換，可大幅避開一些無謂的戰鬥，節省時間和彈藥，在打倒數模式、隱形模式、生存模式等非常好用。

註三: 
這款遊戲一開始被pc玩家幹翻的原因就是劇情co-op(網路雙人)只有家機有(現在還是沒有劇情co-op模式)。而且二者價錢差不多啊。光榮(KOEI)也常常搞這招，pc版的優化很抱歉就是比較差。
不過pc突擊模式有開放網路co-op模式，似乎比較就沒有人罵了~
(20200220更新: 根據開發者的說法 https://steamcommunity.com/app/287290/discussions/0/610574106414653247/?tscn=142537455 ，劇情模式只有單機雙人)

[h1] 三、搜集要素: [/h1]
本作有很多搜集要素，有文件、寶箱(Moira和Natalia的寶箱不同，需分開搜集)
、卡夫卡繪畫(有點好奇這繪畫不知道是不是出自變形記的插畫
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867272168

、鐘樓徽章 
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=864541349

、幼蟲(不確定算不算是bug，搜集完鐘樓徽章和卡夫卡繪畫，遊戲內自己就會說已完成幼蟲搜集)。
非常可以滿足搜集狂的心，尤其透過搜集卡夫卡繪畫的要素可以額外得到機密文件，對了解整個故事，甚至BIO系列來說，非常的重要。

[h1] 四、突擊模式(Raid Mode):[/h1]
這代的突擊模式比啟示1更好玩，如果有登上""RE_net""還會有許多不同的小任務。如果有空有閒的話，找人一起玩突擊模式挑戰也是很棒的。

[h1] 五、dlc:[/h1]
本作是惡靈古堡系列中第一部以章節分開購買的作品，以往這種銷售方式多以互動式電影類遊戲(ex: The walking dead、Life is strange)為主。
為了解整體的故事，請購買完整Deluxe Edition。
除了所有的章節外，還有二個小外傳劇情: 

(一) Struggle(述說Moira怎麼在6個月內的空窗期內活下來)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863338650

還有葉夫根尼這恐龍的過去和現在、

(二) Little Miss(述說Natalia為了找Lottie而踏上旅途的故事。此時Natalia部分精神已開始被Alex侵蝕)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=863966361

[h1]六、翻譯: 	[/h1]
不得不說這代的繁中翻譯真的很棒，翻的對得70分(想當年bio3的官方中譯翻Stars，結果翻「妳死了」~~WTF)，翻的這麼鄉民根本就是滿分啊!!!
最經典的翻譯包含: 「說好不打臉的(獎盃)」、「老闆，去捅你的菊花吧 」
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=861690597

(不過這部比較沒什麼生科的專有名詞，像The last of Us翻的也不差，但專有名詞錯誤太多)

[h1]七、其它:	[/h1]
本作有不少地方向Naughty Dog的遊戲致敬，諸如: 
(1)Natalia的武器是磚頭，很多搜集要素需要用磚頭砸，很像The last of us，主角常常拿磚頭砸菇菇人或是火螢徽章一樣~(是說我個人真的是為了The last of us才買PS4的)、
(2)Claire和Moira最後的大逃亡，Moira把門撬倒後，Claire在跳過去、
(3)主角常常要拿箱子或是發電機爬到上一層的模式都和Uncharted、The last of Us系列類似、
(4)Barry的父愛大爆發(對Moira、Natalia，另外，Barry也把Chirs兄妹視為自己的兒女) 

另外，有人說這部作品也是向三上真司-the evil within的致敬或嗆聲作，但這部作品我買了還沒玩(看起來好毛喔)，暫時不予置評。

[h1]八、小結 	[/h1]
以劇情來說，我個人認為這絕對是惡靈古堡劇情的前三名之作(其實我想投第一名)，連結性有與歷代的關聯、深度在與變形記結合之後也明顯提昇。[啟示1其實也有引用文學作品-但丁的""神曲""的句子，但劇情主要是放在FBC老闆的陰謀和野心，連結度覺得不是很高]。另以遊戲性來說，要件搜集多、為了遊戲獎盃再玩性也高，想要全成就至少會玩個3、4 輪~

Resident Evil: Revelations 2 (2015) nimmt die Elemente die Fans an seinem Vorgänger von 2013 gefielen und bessert sie aus; Eine sehr gute Mischung zwischen Horror und Action ist das Ergebnis.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Ohne etwas zu spoilern sei gesagt, dass manche [u]Entscheidungen von Claire und Moiras Kampagne die Geschichte von Barry und Natalia leicht beeinflussen können[/u]. Es lohnt sich also durchaus das Spiel mindestens zwei Mal durchzuspielen und verschiedene Lösungsansätze auszuprobieren.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561905566

Wie bei RE: Revelations ist Revelations 2 in Episoden unterteilt welche jeweils aus zwei Teilen bestehen. In dem jeweils ersten Teil jeder Episode begleiten sie Claire Redfield [spoiler](Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil CODE: Veronica, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City)[/spoiler] und ihrer Partnerin Moira Burton. In den zweiten Teilen Barry Burton [spoiler](Resident Evil, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil Gaiden)[/spoiler], Moiras Vater, und Natalia Korda, einer Überlebenden aus Terragrigia (vgl. RE Revelations).

Während einer TerraSave Firmenfeier werden Moira und Claire sowie der Rest der Anwesenden entführt und auf eine mit Überwachungskameras versehenen Insel in der Ostsee hin verschleppt. Dort erhalten alle Armreifen die stark an die Halsbänder von Battle Royale (Roman 1999, Film 2000) erinnern und versuchen um ihr Überleben zu kämpfen während sie von der Kafka zitierenden Aufseherin manipuliert werden. Ein halbes Jahr nach diesen Ereignissen erreicht Barry Burton die Insel um seine Tochter zu retten. Sofort trifft er auf die kleine Natalia, ein einsames Mädchen das nicht von seiner Seite weichen will.

Moira und ihr Vater, Barry, sind beide sehr lebhaft und bringen mit ihrem Charme das Spiel zum Leben. Vor allem Moira und Claire ergänzen sich in ihren Gesprächen sehr gut. Schade nur dass Barrys Schwung nicht so ganz auf Natalia abfärbt. Dialoge mit ihr wirken häufiger etwas steif. Was Natalia jedoch nicht an Esprit hat, macht sie jedoch mit ihren Fähigkeiten wett.


[h1]Mechanik[/h1]

Sie können ihre Charaktere sowohl mit der PC-typischen Tastatur/Maus Kombo oder aber einem Gamepad Ihrer Wahl steuern. Und anders als bei Resident Evil 5 und Resident Evil 6 gibt es in diesem Ableger keine Quick Time Events (QTEs). Naja, fast keine. Greift ein Gegner sie, müssen sie den Analog Stick bzw. die Maus bewegen. Ein QTE mit dem es sich durchaus leben lässt.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561903935

[list]
[*] [b]Einzelspieler[/b]

Falls Sie alleine spielen, können Sie, anders als bei vorherigen Resident Evil Spielen, nun jeder Zeit zwischen den beiden Protagonisten wechseln anstelle sich vor dem Kapitel für einen entscheiden zu müssen, bzw. einen vorgeschrieben zu bekommen. Und wechseln lohnt sich.

Claire und Barry sind beides erfahrene Kämpfer und mit Schusswaffen ausgerüstet. Moira und Natalia sind hingegen eher die [i]analytischen Charaktere[/i]. Moira kann mit ihrer Brechstange Türen und Schatztruhen öffnen und mit ihrer Taschenlampe dunkle Gegenden erkunden und versteckte Objekte ausfindig machen. Zudem kann sie Partnercombos initiieren. Natalia wiederum kann Gegner nur schaden wenn sie einen Ziegelstein findet den sie auf sie auf sie werfen kann; Dafür ist sie aber in der Lage versteckte Objekte zu finden, Schatztruhen zu öffnen und Gegner durch Wände zu sehen und ihre Schwachstellen auszumachen.

Natalia ist weitaus wichtiger beim besiegen von Gegnern als Moira und Sie werden konstant zu Natalia wechseln um zu sehen wo Gegner sind und wie sie diese besiegen können. Aber leider ist die Partnermechanik bei Moira und Claire weniger wichtig, zumindest im Einzelspieler. Claire könnte nämlich genau so gut sowohl Pistole als auch Taschenlampe halten und somit das ganze alleine durchstehen, bzw. Moira käme mit ihrer Nahkampfwaffe und Taschenlampe auch fast ohne Claire aus.

[*] [b]Zweispieler[/b]

Die Kampagne können Sie im lokalen Coop mit Splitscreen spielen. Es ist ziemlich toll von Capcom endlich mal lokalen Coop in seinen Resident Evil Spielen zu haben, allerdings ist es schade, dass sie dafür den Online Coop abschafften.

Falls sie den Coop spielen sollten, wäre es am besten wenn beide Spieler ein Gamepad nutzten, da es bei manchen Nutzern zu Problemen kam wenn einer mit dem Keyboard und der andere mit Controller spielt.

[*] [b]Crafting[/b]

Das Spiel hat ein rudimentäres Crafting System. Sie können Waffen oder Erste Hilfe Materialien erstellen indem Flaschen oder Verbandsmaterial mit Schießpulver oder Alkohol oder Pulver verbinden.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=561904930

[*] [b]Leveling[/b]

Ähnlich wie bei den Vorgängern können Sie erhaltene Punkte können Sie zudem dazu benutzen verschiedene Fähigkeiten, wie Natalias Kräfte zu aufzubessern. Allerdings ist es viel schwerer unendliche Munition freizuschalten.
[/list]

[h1]Extra-Episoden[/h1]

[u]Beide optionalen Missionen enthalten Spoiler[/u], lohnen sich aber gespielt zu werden nachdem die Hauptkampagne beendet wurde. Nach Beenden beider Missionen erhalten Sie zudem >400,000BP.

[*] [b]Eine kleine Frau[/b]

In dieser Stealth Mission begleiten Sie Natalia bei der Suche nach ihrem Teddybären Lottie. Die Mission ist ungefähr 20 Minuten lang und spielt sich komplett anders als der Rest des Spiels, was sehr erfrischend ist. Und obwohl sie zwar kurz ist, lohnt es sich sie zu spielen da sie einen guten Einblick in das was in Natalias Psyche gibt.

[*] [b]Die Prüfung[/b]

Moiras [i]Die Prüfung[/i] erinnert eher an die Actionsequenzen von Chris Redfield aus RE: Revelations oder an RE 6. Sie müssen zum einen versuchen genügend Nahrung zu jagen, zum anderen sich die Gegner vom Hals halten und zwar alles mit begrenzter Munition. Ähnlich wie Natalias Extra-Episode dauert Moiras ebenfalls ungefähr 20 Minuten und gibt einen Einblick auf das, was auf der Insel passiert.
[/list]

[h1]Spiel Modi[/h1]

[list]
[*] [b]Unsichtbar[/b]

Ihre Gegner sind nur dann kurz sichtbar wenn Moira mit ihrer Taschenlampe oder Natalia mit ihrem Finger auf sie zeigen. Eher etwas für Coop. Vor allem Bosskämpfe sind alleine recht schwer.

[*] [b]Auf Zeit[/b]

Sie müssen Level innerhalb der vorgegebenen Zeit durchspielen. Nichts für schwächere Computer geeignet, dynamische Licht- oder Wassereffekten können Framedrops erzeugen.

[*] [b]Raid Mode[/b]

Einziger Modus mit Online Coop. Die Level sind nach einer von drei Arten aufgebaut
[olist]
[*] Alle Gegner töten
[*] Ziel beschützen
[*] Level in vorgegebener Zeit abschließen.
[/olist]

Spaßig, aber nicht für jeden.
[/list]
[h1]Throwback Map Pack[/h1]

Die zusätzlichen Karten stammen aus RE 6 und Revelations und Sie finden sie indem Sie bei der Levelauswahl im Raid Modus ganz nach unten scrollen. Es war durchaus spaßig wieder in die Haupthalle der Queen Zenobia zurückgeführt zu werden und die Karten mit ihren zusätzlichen Herausforderungen lohnen sich durchaus für Fans des Raid Moduses, sind aber nichts für SpielerInnen die kein, bzw. wenig Interesse am Multispieler haben.

[h1]Kostümpaket[/h1]

Wenn Sie das Spiel spielen, schalten Sie eventuell Kostüme für Ihre Charaktere frei. Das Kostümpaket stellt Ihnen aber noch vier weitere zur Verfügung. Die für Moiras und Claire enthaltene Garderobe (Urban Ninja und Rodeo) sagt mir nicht zu, aber Lotties Outfit und Barrys Uniform sehen richtig schick aus.

[h1]Fazit[/h1]

Resident Evil: Revelations 2 spielen Sie in ungefähr 7-8 Stunden durch. Die Story ist um etliches kompakter und fokussierter als in vorherigen Resident Evil Spielen, was durchaus gut ist. Während mir die Moira und Claire Kampagne von den Charakteren her besser gefiel, hatte die von Barry und Natalia eine bessere Spielmechanik.",6281,german

[h1][u]Introduction  du propos[/u][/h1]

Tout d’abord, je pense qu’il y a beaucoup de choses à dire sur ce jeu. C’est un jeu que j’ai attendu très longtemps, il y a eu des rumeurs et puis cela s’est concrétisé petit à petit par la suite. Je dis tout ça pour en venir sur le fait que : oui, comme beaucoup de joueurs, j’ai eu de gros problèmes avec le jeu le jour de sa sortie : le jeu était  injouable, avec des énormes lags (et ce même avec les graphismes les plus bas), j’étais donc énormément frustré. Oui, le jeu n’est pas stable mais Capcom a travaillé et travaille dessus. J’ai pu lire de nombreuses critiques qui ne tournaient qu’autour de ce point. Ces critiques en oubliaient l’essentiel, le jeu lui-même. Pour ma part, mes problèmes sont réglés, passons donc à une vraie critique.


[h1][u]Evaluation[/u][/h1]

Pour commencer, le scénario. Le scénario m’a rapidement intrigué, au fur et à mesure que l’on joue on se pose de nombreuses questions et tout cela en attendant les épisodes suivants : on est alors bien ancré dans le jeu. Le plus remarquable dans ce Resident Evil, c’est que c’est un Resident Evil intelligent, je m’explique : en jouant j’ai aperçu de nombreux points communs avec les précédents : Revelations 2 « pioche » dans ces prédécesseurs tout en y ajoutant sa touche d’originalité. Il reprend les éléments positifs des anciens. Ainsi on peut y retrouver l’ambiance du jeu premier du nom, mais pas seulement l’ambiance, certains décors, des références, etc. Enfin bon je ne vais pas tout vous dévoiler… J’ai bien évidemment retrouvé du RE2 avec notre fameuse Claire Redfield dont j’attendais le retour avec impatience. Certains endroits tels que la prison ou encore certains monstres  (Les revenants par exemple) et quelques passages me rappellent fortement Resident Evil Code Veronica ([spoiler]Sans parler d’Alex Wesker qui rappelle fortement Alexia[/spoiler]). On peut aussi voir une référence à RE3 avec un ennemi nous rappelant Némésis, vous comprendrez la référence si vous êtes connaisseur ! RE1, RE2, RECV, RE3 et ce n’est pas fini… Certains lieux : le village par exemple, la mine, la zone souterraine et certaines fois l’ambiance pesante et mystérieuse de RE4 sont présents. Mais où sont donc RE5, RE6 et RER ? Dans le scénario du jeu et dans le gameplay même. On retrouve ainsi le système de campagnes séparées à 2 joueurs comme dans RE5 et RE6, les QTE, le système d’armes et d’améliorations avec des éléments comme dans Resident Evil : Revelations et encore pleins de chose que je ne cite pas. 

Mais vous allez me dire en fait : c’est seulement un mixe des anciens RE quoi…Pas du tout, l’ambiance et certains décors se rapprochent certes des anciens mais le jeu lui-même est unique et apporte sa touche : ainsi un nouveau système est intégré au jeu, celui des combinaisons d’objets, que je trouve pour ma part intéressant, pour obtenir des Molotov vous devez collecter des bouteilles vides et de l’alcool que vous devez combiner, pour obtenir des explosifs il vous faut des bouteilles vides et de la poudre à canon, etc. Ensuite, on apprend assez tôt que l’on peut faire certains passages discrètement avec des coups furtifs, bien heureusement pas nécessaire pour finir le jeu (ce n’est pas un jeu d’infiltration), mais cela apporte un nouvel angle de jeu nous donnant accès à plusieurs méthodes pour arriver à nos fins. Enfin, l’histoire du jeu est neuve, notamment la relation Barry/Moira, mais l’histoire n’est pas isolée et c’est cela que j’apprécie tout particulièrement dans ce jeu. Je  m’explique, en jouant à un RE par exemple le 4 (un de mes préférés) on s’aperçoit parfois qu’il a peu de rapport avec les autres en termes de scénario. Dans celui-là de nombreux RE sont raccordés et notamment RER, RE5 et RE6 : ce qui est fort. Le plus surprenant c’est que le scénario est bon et pas comme dans le 6 (et je me cache pas de le dire) et ce même en « rattrapant » les gaffes commises ! De plus le scénario nous propose deux fins différentes ([spoiler]selon le choix de tuer Neil avec Claire ou Moira[/spoiler])…ce que je trouve sympa ça me rappelle RE1.  Le seul bémol sur le scénario c’est que je n’ai pas beaucoup vu de Resident Evil : Revelations ; un peu, mais pas assez car après tout il s’appelle Revelations 2 donc ne soyez pas dessus : pas de Jessica, Raymond ou autre ! 
Par contre je suis déçu de ne pas voir de coopération en campagne… beaucoup ont demandé du split qui est finalement arrivé. Mais au final ce qui m’intéressait, et je pense qu’il n’y a pas que moi que ça intéressait, c’était de pouvoir jouer en ligne avec des amis. Et Capcom ne semble pas nous écouter sur ce point.

En terme de durée de vie il n’y a rien à redire (pour moi) j’avais peur avec seulement 4 épisode à 2 scénarios mais pas du tout ! J’ai passé beaucoup de temps sur la campagne et même plus de temps que sur celle de RER. En plus des modes de difficultés croissants on retrouve le système de médaillons, ajoutez à cela la recherche d’insectes et de dessins de Kafka qui augmentent le nombre d’heures. A cela s’ajoute de nombreux défis et les modes Invisible et Chrono de l’Histoire : je vous laisse deviner par le nom ce que sont ces modes. Enfin deux épisodes bonus sont disponibles (en DLC) si vous n’avez pas acheté l’intégrale. Des épisodes non nécessaires, mais dont l’originalité est à noter. 


[h1][u]Le mode Commando[/u][/h1]

Parlons un peu du mode Commando : le mode commando est propre aux RERs, et moi je le dis j’adore ce mode et je le préfère beaucoup plus au mode mercenaire, après cela reste un point de vue. Pour en savoir un peu plus je vous incite à voir mon évaluation sur Resident Evil : Revelations. Ce qui est cool c’est que ce n’est pas un simple copié-collé du mode Commando du 1. Il est même différent, et je trouve qu’il se situe entre Commando et Mercenaire. Le système de personnage individuel est très intéressant, le nombre de stage est énorme (la durée de vie est donc d’autant plus intéressante), on trouve de nouvelles armes, des anciennes, des habiletés passives et actives, et même des Emotes que l’on peut sélectionner (un petit plus inutile, quoi que…en multi c'est drôle). Enfin bref, pas mal de choses nouvelles et d’anciennes choses qui valent quelques glorifications. Petit bémol : il n'existe pas de gros stage comme le GS dans RER...on perd aussi pas mal le petit côté exploration de l'ancien mode pour retrouver un parcours beaucoup plus linéaire. Dommage.


[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]

Played on: Casual & Normal Difficulty

Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a fantastic entry into the franchise, returning to the B-Movie story lines and schlocky dialogue that the original games are best remembered for. There's still plenty of action to be had but exploration and resource management are usually emphasised over straight combat. 

The main campaign lasts around 6-8 hours and consists of 4 episode split into two chapters each. The first chapter of each episode follows Claire and Moira with a larger focus on horror, whilst the second chapter with Barry and Natalia tends towards being more action heavy. 

While Claire and Barry act as the main 'combat character' for each of there respective chapters, with Moira and Natalia are taking up support roles. The game-play is at it's best when splitting up the characters to make use of their unique abilities. While Moira is able to blind enemies with her flash-light and open barred doors with her crowbar, Natalia can craw into small gaps in the wall and sense nearby enemies, which often comes in useful for a stealthy approach or spotting enemy weak points. Both support characters can also spot hidden objects and are needed to find collectables hidden throughout the game.

The game looks fine graphically, and there isn't much to say about the sound design. There are some performance issues at times (normally when loading into a new area), but there's a mod that can help with that and it's never so bad as to make the game unplayable. At worst it's a minor annoyance which is quickly forgotten.

Although the story-line (never a strong point with Resident Evil games) is nothing special, the locations are mostly forgettable and the enemies aren't anything amazing, it's a definite step-up from the first revelations games.

There's a lot of fun to be had here, and a good amount of replay value on offer. Actions in Claire's Campaign impact on Barry's and there are two campaign endings on offer. Each of the main campaign's episodes offer 4 difficulties, with 2 additional game modes (Countdown and Invisible Enemies), in addition to a range of challenges (Medals and Records) and collectables (Kafka Drawings, Insect Larva and Tower Emblems).

At the conclusion of each chapter the player is awarded with BP which can be used to unlock new player skills, or spent on new campaign skills, Figurines, Concept Art, Costumes, Weapons, Screen Filters and more.

Raid mode is the real highlight here though offering some serious longevity outside the main campaign. The progression feels fair, especially with the rest bonus and daily challenge mechanics. There's plenty of maps, characters, weapons, weapon parts and skills to unlock, with a much larger variety of enemies to be found than in the main campaign.",3346,english

When RE4 first came out, it marked a point of no return for the franchise. Following its steps, the first RE:Revelations expanded upon that formula, giving the perfect mix between horror and action, alongside the strongest narrative the series ever had. 

Revelations 2 doesn't follow the plot of the first one, but rather expands upon its foundations featuring a new story. Adding new mechanics inspired by The Last Of Us, the flow and pacing of the main storyline is structured flawlessly. Every chapter has two parts, one in the present time and the other set six months after those events. Doing certain actions during the present part affect the future part, and if you make the wrong decision, you can come up with a very depressing ending... 

Alongside the Campaign Mode comes the return of Raid Mode. Expanded with lots of stages, weapons, customization parts and characters, it's basically a game inside the game. 

But perhaps the best thing about Revelations 2 is it's level and monster design. Crumbling buildings full of rust and dirt, bloodfrenzied maniacs, twisted masses of flesh and iron, creatures wich beg for you to kill them. If you liked Silent Hill's oppresive atmosphere, you're going to love this.


Franz Kafka. Trust me, you're going to know that name.",4722,english
0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"I keep returning to this game specifically for Raid mode. The gameplay loop is really fun and addictive, and the monster variety is wide and clever enough to force occasional changes in strategy.
For those looking for a more story-focused experience, the campaign is definitely more of a mixed bag. The setting is interesting, and the parallels the game draws with Kafka's work is compelling at times. However, the attempts to innovate the co-op gameplay fall a bit flat, with companions being endowed with comparatively dull abilities and roles in combat. The core gameplay for the main characters is fundamentally solid, but the constant shift between different characters and backtracking of levels breaks up the pacing and much of the tension. Character dialogue varies significantly in quality. Some characters are quite likeable, believable and seem to show the RE writing style has matured. But then you encounter some characters that are about the same as or worse than previous titles in terms of cheesiness and lack of nuance.
For those in it for a horror experience, while some moments and enemies are visceral, the game isn't especially scary, and it's even less so in co-op. 
Overall, I'd specifically recommend this for fans of RE4/5/et al.-era combat who are looking to scratch that esoteric itch.",1338,english

There only carpets on the walls with a touch of the 70s or a voice-seeing person speaking Russian.

0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"(Although I bought the first episode on sale myself but got the other episodes from a friend) I'm going to start out by saying I've never played a resident evil game before but that I'm also not really a horror person so my opinions are completely seperated from any other resident evil games.

Resident evil revelations 2 has been a fun package so far and I'm still playing to do finish up achievements and I've barely touched raid mode although I have played a bit.
The entire main game is split between 2 parts of a story, one where you play as Claire and Moira trying find out why they are on the island, how to get off and how to stop what's going on whilst the other half you play as Barry and Natalia wanting to save moira and finding out about an enemy fimiliar to Barry with each episode having a bit of both, first Claire and Moira, then Barry and Natalia. 

I quite like the gameplay, it's not super complex but it doesn't need to be. Most of the combat consist of shooting at enemies and dodging with some differences in what you encounter during Claire and Moira's part and Barry and Natalia's part.
As Claire and Moira ammo is often a bit tight but you'll only have to fight off against simple enemies for the most part. The lack of frequent ammo finds makes it important to preserve ammo for when you do have to face off against a more difficult enemy so for that you have moira's flashlight, as Moira can't use guns she uses her somehow mega bright item detecting flashlight to stun enemies by shining in their face giving Claire the opertunity to knock them down where Moira can then perform an excecution, her flashlight can also be used to find slightly less obvious items to stock up and a hidden collectable called Kafka Drawings.

When playing as Barry and Natalia you come better equiped and you find more ammo to face the enemies on the island and so you face a wider aray of enemies that require you to get to their weakspot and pump that full of lead. This time Barry has the guns AND flashlight, however for some reason it's not bright enough or something to reveal hidden images, items or stun monsters. But for not having that you have a small girl with you called Natalia that can use her short length to crawl trough small spaces that Barry can't get through. Natalia also has a special power where she can detect monsters through walls and see where their weakspot is located, she can also use her magic finger to point out where items are that you previously had to use Moira's flashlight for. When playing as Barry and Natalia you also sometimes encounter parts where you are able to stealth past enemies, sneaking up behind them and finishing them off with one quick execution.
For those who think of stealth sections in disgust, you have to note that stealthing is very much optional and there is no real penalty for just shooting them or even just running away besides from saving some health and ammo, and even then, I still recomend trying it as it's really not bad and I quite enjoyed sneaking around.

As for the story, it's a neat experience to experience with some questions arising early on with more along the way and a couple of twists as you alternate between the Claire and Moira story and the Barry and Natalia story that weave together eventually leading to a fun conclussion. And as someone who has never played any other resident evil games I can say that I was easily able to understand the story minus some parts like reoccuring names and stuff although you don't NEED to know those, it mostly makes it more interesting for people who have played the other games.

For the raid mode, the little I have played of it I played with a friend and we were having a blast the whole way through, it's a way more arcade-y shooter where you clear out the enemies but that's just the fun distraction some people need, it opens up more as you progress through the game and even has some things not present in the main game for added enjoyment.

Now there are of course some gripes I have with the game and I'd like to adress them here.
In the way of unlocking extras the game feels a bit unsatisfying to me as when you unlock something you don't actually get it, instead you get the ability to buy it with ingame points that you also use to upgrade your character which to me at least kindof undermines your acomplishments. Some enemies also felt WAY too tanky to me whilst being able to utterly obliterate you in 2 attacks like the Dhurlga you encounter at multiple points during Barry's parts and [spoiler] Mutant Pedro having way too hard to hit weakspots sometimes whilst having an instantkill attack where he rushes at you with his drill, it was way too easy too fall off the crane in barry's episode 4 [/spoiler] and some parts send you back a bit too far when you died in my opinion. I also find it weird that there is online multiplayer in raid mode but the main story is local only.

Now to adress some problems I frequently see people talk about.
Yes, the game is episodic but when you buy the game with the 3 other episodes or get the deluxe edition it's still around the same price or even cheaper than some of the other games in the series. And to those who were angry about not buying a full game, they make it quite clear that this is just the first episode, both in the name, the about section and the DLC list.
You must also know that this isn't a full on horror game, besides from a couple of quick spooks for the unaware and some enemy designs I guess it really isn't so if pure horror is what you're looking for you might not like this. However, as an action game it's a fun experience with a slight amount of ammo management.

Concerning the price, If you're only planning to play through the story made and not touch it again I might suggest waiting until a sale to get it but if you take your time to try and go for the achievements and/or you sink some time in the arcade style fun that is raid mode with a friend you might be able to consider getting it even at full price.

All in all, I think this game is great fun and definitely worth picking up at least some time.",1307,english
0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"RE 6 set the bar low, but this is quite competent RE game. Episodic structure seems to work fine in story mode, as characters working in pairs. The story isn't the strong point here, as usual, and the appearance of that particular voice actress from SH series doesn't do much to help. Also, these quotes from F.Kafka are WTF material in general, and not really meaningful inspiration. The dialogue is on par with usual RE B-movie horror style, although if you're an English native, Moira's teenage millennial bits will probably make your ears bleed. The environments have a bit of a Silent Hill vibe, which is nice.

The controls (gamepad) are solid, and so is the gameplay. The Story can be challenging, even on Normal difficulty, and you have to conserve resources to survive. I tried the Countdown Mode, and the Invisible Mode as well, but I found it way too punishing. The Raid Mode is really addictive though – more interesting than Mercenaries, with all the leveling and RPG grind mechanics, despite most arenas having been ripped from RE 6.

""Resident Evil Revelations 2"" besticht durch sein spaßiges Koop-Gameplay und der im Allgemeinen recht kurzweiligen Unterhaltung im Stil von Resident Evil 4, 5 und 6. Es bietet aber auch so gut wie keinerlei neuer Ideen oder progressiver Anreize und fühlt sich vom Gameplay her oft ein wenig fad an. 

Das Gameplay ist ganz gut, bitte nicht falsch verstehen. Resi 4 & 5 sind tolle Spiele, die mir immer noch im Gedächtnis herumschwirren. Das spaßige Gunplay und die tollen Koop- sowie Survival-Elemente: Das alles ist ebenfalls in Resi Revelations 2 vorhanden, wenn vielleicht auch in einer geringfügig ""kruderen"" Variante. Nichtsdestotrotz bietet Revelations 2 ein ziemlich zeitloses Gameplay, zu dem man meiner Meinung nach immer mal wieder für eine kurzweilige Runde zurückkehren kann, wenn man Unterhaltung für 1-2 Stunden sucht. Den Entwicklern ist dies scheinbar auch bewusst, sonst gäbe es den umfangreichen Raid-Modus wohl nicht. 
Auf der anderen Seite hat man das als Serienkenner natürlich bereits alles schon mal gesehen: 
- Gegner, die man an einer bestimmten Stelle treffen muss? Check. 
- Crafting mit Kräutern und Chemikalien + Waffen tunen? Jupp. 
- Schlüssel, Edelsteine und Schalter, die gefunden, irgendwo hineingesteckt und betätigt werden wollen? Klar doch. 
Das alles überrascht einen nicht mehr und zumindest mir kam das Ganze ab und zu ein wenig langweilig vor. Es ist erstaunlich, wie sehr Revelations 2 auf ""altbewährtes"" setzt und keinerlei neue Anreize für Fans der Serie bietet. Stattdessen wird sich an Franz Kafka versucht und das sogar ein wenig unbeholfen und aufgesetzt. Ich verstehe, woher die Idee kommt, da eine der zentralen Themen ja die Furcht ist, nur ist Revelations 2 weder besonders fürchterlich, noch in irgendeiner Form kafkaesk. 

Die Story an sich ist solide erzählt, recht unterhaltsam und hier und da kommt auch mal Spannung auf. Sie ist allerdings auch ein wenig vorhersehbar und die Dialoge und Ereignisse sind manchmal zum Fremdschämen trashig. Typisch Japan (und Resident Evil) schwingt immer ein Hauch Albernheit mit, insgesamt bin ich nach dem Finale aber recht zufrieden gewesen. Wenn man will, kann man dann versuchen, das zweite Ende zu erspielen, die Extra-Kapitel ausprobieren oder einige Spielstunden im spaßigen aber anspruchslosen Raid-Modus versenken. Man bekommt also ein relativ umfangreiches Gesamtpaket. 

Auch die Technik ist solide, jedoch nicht mehr. Für ein Game aus dem Jahr 2015 sieht Revelations 2 nicht besonders gut aus. Wenn man aber gleichzeitig die PlayStation Vita-Wurzeln mit in die Bewertung einbezieht, so gibt das Spiel doch einen recht ordentlichen Gesamteindruck ab. Die Charaktermodelle sehen jedoch ganz schick aus und auch der Sound kann sich hören lassen. 

Was aus meiner Sicht jedoch gar nicht geht, ist, wie ""zerhackstückelt"" das Spiel von CAPCOM angeboten wird. Muss man ein bestenfalls ""solides"" Spiel so krass monetarisieren?! Nein, muss man nicht! Ich kann das Spiel empfehlen, ja, wer mehr vom bekannten Resi-Gameplay haben möchte, wird hier sehr gut bedient. Ich würde allerdings nur im Sale zuschlagen.

-Claire and Barry are in it

CONS:
-The two buddy characters are also in it
-The gameplay is painfully boring
-Looks like a low-rent Silent Hill more than a Resident Evil


(This was played solo, without the co-op mode)
Only finished the first episode of four but already have no interest in continuing. I'll be speaking purely on the portion of the game I played.

Mediocre clone of The Last of Us gameplay-wise, while not executing any of that game's ideas particularly well. Enemy placement seems pretty lazy, with them oftentimes being clumped together in small rooms, only to rush you down the moment you're near them. Damage calculation is confusing (and may make no difference depending on the part of the body it's dealt to), with the enemies sometimes taking more or less shots to vital areas to die, with seemingly no reason for it. For example, low tier enemies can take anywhere from 1-7 shots directly to the head to actually die. This can be a bit of a problem considering the game is Survival Horror and limits resources.

Buddy characters are basically useless when you aren't controlling them, as they don't have any meaningful weapons and often run right into groups of enemies to be attacked, with no useful way to defend themselves. The Buddy characters unfortunately also have crucial context-sensitive mechanics tied to them which means switching characters quite often in Solo mode to perform minor tasks like opening boxes or accessing certain areas. Buddy characters are also constantly making repetitive quips in reaction to things you do, which can get really grating after a while (Moira is especially obnoxious at times).

Enemy and environment design is decent but seems more in line with Silent Hill than Resident Evil. This isn't really a problem, just something that seemed worth mentioning. Unfortunately the areas aren't all that interesting to look at and you traverse through them twice, once for each duo of characters. This was likely a budget issue, but it definitely doesn't help the game feel engaging when you're seeing the same generic spooky locations again. Enemies are also pretty bland, varying between shambling rotted corpse in military-ish garb, lanky monster man with destructible RE5 Oroboros limbs and big muscular Pyramid Head wannabe.

I can't really speak on the story, as I only played through one episode, but what I saw was pretty lackluster. The mysterious antagonist forces (and the game itself) beat you over the head with seemingly endless Franz Kafka quotes from the start, in what I'm assuming is an attempt to be deep or thought-provoking but instead it's almost immediately obnoxious as hell and borders on pretentious. Anytime the mysterious evil lady called Claire on her bracelet I just wanted to mute the game so I wouldn't have to hear it. The dialogue in general is pretty awful, with Moira in particular constantly saying ""Fuck"" in almost every sentence and spitting out some truly cringe-worthy attempts at humor any chance she gets. For example, saying ""Fucking shit on a stick"" during a cutscene that's supposed to be serious where she's trying to send out a call for help over radio. 

If you're a fan of the Resident Evil series, I can't really recommend this one unless you've got a bored friend over and maybe a drink or two to make things a little less miserable.",113,english

+ Barry's character was surprisingly intact
+ Natalia's backstory was genuinely compelling and enigmatic
+ Handful of legitimate scary/creepy enemies

+ Lots of hidden collectibles that are satisfying to collect

+/- Two different endings (Good/Bad) depending on whether or not you press a hidden action prompt at the end of Claire's Episode 3

• Resident Evil: Revelations 2, conhecido como Biohazard Revelations 2 (バイオハザード リベレーションズ 2, Baiohazādo Riberēshonzu Tsū) no Japão, é um jogo de survival horror dividido em epísódios, décimo capitulo da série Resident Evil, e desenvolvido e publicado pela Capcom. Apesar do nome, o jogo não é uma sequência direta de Resident Evil: Revelations.

- A trama do jogo se passa depois de Resident Evil 5 e antes de Resident Evil 6.

Tudo começa num coquetel com colegas e amigos da Terra Save. Lá, em especial, está a protagonista Claire Redfield. Moira Burton, filha de Barry Burton, agora é novata da Terra Save. Ela e Claire têm uma amizade muito forte, como irmãs. Mas, durante a festa, são pegos e levados por homens desconhecidos para uma ilha enigmática. Claire e Moira terão de sair de lá vivas e descobrirem quem está por trás disto tudo e o motivo de estarem lá. Seis meses depois do ocorrido, Barry vai para ilha com a intenção de encontrar Moira, sua filha. Por surpresa, chegando lá, encontra uma garotinha misteriosa chamada Natalia. Natalia o auxilia durante todo o jogo até finalmente encontrarem uma mulher que se auto-intitula como ""A Supervisora"".

-Os personagens terão de enfrentar criaturas horrendas e assustadoras. Há emblemas espalhados pelo cenário, como no Resident Evil 4 e Resident Evil 5. Há desenhos de Kafka, um escritor cujas frases são citadas várias vezes pela autointulada ""A Supervisora"", e inseridas na tela de carregamento de cada novo capítulo.

Claire e Barry são os personagens que usam armas de fogo diversificadas. Natalia usa apenas tijolos como arma contra inimigos, no entanto tem o dom de enxergar inimigos de longe, com uma aura cobrindo-os, e também pode enxergar itens ocultos nos cenários e larvas de insetos. Já Moira pode cegar inimigos com sua lanterna e bater neles com seu pé de cabra, que também é usado para quebrar madeiras que impeçam a passagem através de alguma porta.

Existem dois episódios extras: um com a Moira, que mostra como foi sua jornada de seis longos meses tentando sobreviver na ilha após sofrer um acidente no episódio 4; e o outro com Natalia e seu ""lado sombrio"" como personagens jogáveis.

Depois do Resident Evil 4, um jogo que não apenas redefiniu a franquia, como também estabeleceu novos padrões de qualidade para a indústria como um todo, a Capcom parece ter se perdido quanto à direção. E não é para menos, já que Shinji Mikami deixou a companhia logo após o lançamento do RE4. Lá pra meados de 2012, se Resident Evil 6 possuía um enredo megalomaníaco que refletia nas situações bizarras pelas quais o jogador tinha que passar (nunca me esquecerei de como foi TRAUMÁTICO dirigir aquele carro no meio do apocalipse), Revelations 2 preza por algo mais intimista e envolvente. A história, escrita por Dai Sato, responsável pelo roteiro de obras como Ghost in the Shell, Wolf’s Rain e o primeiro Resident Evil Revelations, é um dos pontos mais fortes do título. Com um progresso envolvente e diversos mistérios a serem revelados, Revelations 2 possui diversos momentos memoráveis, além de referências EXCELENTES a vários jogos da franquia, há refênciasliterárias(Franz Kafka simplesmente reina nos arquivos do jogo) que, se lidas antes do jogo, colaboram para a imersão e entendimento dos acontecimentos.

Passando-se entre Resident Evil 5 e 6, a história tem início quando um grupo de pessoas que servem a Terra Save(organização não governamental que luta contra o bioterrorismo), é sequestrado e levado a uma ilha misteriosa. Entre as pessoas, estão Claire Redfield, protagonista de Resident Evil 2 e muito conhecida pelos fãs, e Moira Burton, filha de Barry, do primeiro Resident Evil. Sem nem saber o que está se passando, o jogador se vê no controle de Claire em um local que parece uma prisão. Utilizando uma misteriosa pulseira que não pode ser retirada, a protagonista ouve gritos de socorro de Moira e corre para salvá-la. Juntas as duas terão que se desdobrar para escapar daquele lugar enquanto investigam  quem as levou até lá. Paralelamente ao que acontece com Claire e Moira, Barry resolve ir até a ilha para salvar sua filha. Logo ao chegar ele encontra Natalia, uma misteriosa menininha que estava vagando pela ilha. Com medo de que a garota corresse perigo, Barry decide levá-la consigo em sua missão, sem saber que a garota se tornaria peça fundamental para seu progresso.

Desde Resident Evil 5 a Capcom vem investindo em modos cooperativos na série, o que foi um grande acerto para uns mas para outros acabou por ""tirar a essência"" singleplayer da franquia, que acabou prezando pela ação ao invés do terror. Revelations 2 retorna com mais uma tentativa mais ousada. O multiplayer é assimétrico, ou seja, cada jogador desempenha uma função. Enquanto Barry e Claire portam armas de fogo e são responsáveis pelo combate, Natalia e Moira servem para ajudar os protagonistas identificando itens escondidos. Moira possui apenas uma lanterna e um pé-de-cabra. Enquanto a lanterna serve para encontrar itens perdidos e atordoar inimigos no estilo Alan Wake, o pé-de-cabra serve para finalizar os inimigos derrubados por Claire e abrir portas antes trancadas por tábuas. Já Natalia possui um bizarro poder que possibilita que ela detecte inimigos invisíveis ou até mesmo os pontos fracos de outros. A garota ainda pode, assim como Moira, finalizar inimigos, só que com tijolos.

A parte mais legal de tudo isso é que as parceiras dos protagonistas estimulam tipos diferentes de gameplay. Enquanto Moira pode chamar a atenção dos inimigos para que Claire os finalize, as habilidades de Natalia estimulam um estilo de jogo mais furtivo, que em alguns momentos chega a lembrar vagamente de The Last of Us. Entretanto, nem tudo são flores. Enquanto o título brilha quando jogado em multiplayer, o modo singleplayer acaba deixando a desejar. Em primeiro lugar, a inteligência artificial de seu parceiro é HORRÍVEL e ele dificilmente ajuda em alguma coisa, chegando até a atrapalhar em alguns momentos(RECOMENDAÇÃO: Apesar da Claire/Barry serem os protagonistas principais, recomendo jogar com a Moira/Natalia a partir do momento que você desbloquear a skill do ""parceiro atira em inimigos sem gastar munição"" e jogá-los com ele apenas em boss fights, pra poder encontrar itens escondidos e matar inimigos mais facilmente). Para resolver esse problema, a Capcom decidiu retornar com a mecânica de troca de personagens de Resident Evil 0, o que acaba não funcionando 100% justamente pelas diferenças entre os personagens. Quando controlamos Moira, por exemplo, não podemos atacar os inimigos decentemente. Em contrapartida, se controlamos Claire, Moira não ajuda em absolutamente NADA e acabamos deixando muita coisa passar batida.

Resident Evil Revelations 2, apesar dos defeitos, tem qualidades que se sobressaem e fazem com que a sub-série seja melhor do que a principal dos dias de hoje. Contando com um enredo envolvente, referências ESPETACULARES a jogos antigos da franquia e literárias e uma jogabilidade variada e divertida, o jogo cumpre o que promete e, pra mim, é um dos melhores da franquia.

0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"When I found out that RE had once again theirs games in sale, I just couldn't REsist. I am a big RE fan, so I was incredibly hyped. I bought the game and started playing. I set my hopes high, due to Resident Evil Revelations being my personal favourite Resident Evil game. The beginning of the game felt like a huge disappointment. Claire was there, which was cool, but Moira...well, let's say that I firstly was truly annoyed whenever she would open her mouth. She felt like a stereotypical teenager (even though she isn't, since she's working for the company where Claire also works). By time I got used to her and at the end, I even was liking her. Just a little bit xd. The premise of the story didn't amaze me, an average okay rating would be fitting, but I definitely liked the gameplay. After playing RE6, this actually made me feel, like I was playing Resident Evil once again. Though I did have thoughts of bringing back that slide mechanic when running and pressing the right mouse button xd. It wasn't scary, but it gave off some of those creepy vibes. That marionette type of enemy (if you played the game, you know what I am talking about) would give me the heebie jeebies every time they'd show up. Those two story lines at first didn't make sense to me (The Claire story line and the Barry story line), but after what came during the final 20 minutes, it all clicked perfectly. I must say, that even if I like Claire, as much as I do, Barry's story line was more fun, scary and overall much more Resident Evil-ly. I especially liked Natalia's ability to sense monsters. This turned out to be usefull and it made an unique gameplay. Claire story line has also some great moments. Alex Wesker was a greatly designed antigonist that could be coming back soon. I loved the references to Kafka's The Metamorphosis. I don't know why, but Revelations has these book related references. The first game uses Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy, and the second one uses Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis. As a Czech, this brings a smile to my face. The end was outstanding, I haven't enjoyed a finale like that for a really long period of time. The defeat of Alex, the daughter of Albert Wesker (Albert - one of the best villains in gaming history), was ended in a classic RE fashion with a rocket launcher. It felt amazing. 
To summarize it all, the game started with various emtions of love and hate, halved emotions to be specific, but ended with joy and happiness, peace and tranquility. Even if the game started nightmarish, I fully enjoyed the scary middle and the dope ending with the grotesque metamorphosis. 
A Kafkaesque experience. 7.75/10",963,english

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are not that bad actually. The UI though, is absolutely messy and terrible. I can not stand the design of it. The environmental detail and design is really top notch and impressive, especially for a game made in 2015. The lighting is not that good though. It’s bland and I never seen the reason for the flashlight (besides to stun the enemy and find “hidden” items).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is pretty good in my opinion, but with some issues I don’t like at all. I would say the movement is really good in this one. The gunplay is pretty good and fits with the fast action this game provides. You do have to switch between characters through the game. Claire is your main character, while Moira can flash the enemy with her light. If you switch to her you can light up objects through the map and get extra ammo and medical supplies, same goes for Barry's companion, Natalia, except she can see enemies through walls. I will say that the enemy designs are not that great, and feel really uninspiring. This doesn’t help the fact that there are so few in terms of enemy variety. Now maybe this was the trend at the time, but I have a sneaky feeling this game was influenced by the Evil Within, and Outlast. The enemies have that style that I can not shake off, and just feels like the enemy design doesn’t fit for a Resident Evil game. You do have a good amount of weapons in this game as well. You also can upgrade your weapons which is really cool. The biggest gripe I have is the mouse controls. I get this weird input lag, I can't put my finger on it, also the camera movement is really weird and brings me a feeling of hate for this game. If you are using a controller, then you will have zero issues at all.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story was pretty forgettable in my opinion. The only part of the story I enjoyed was the whole Barry trying to find his daughter. You have two sides to the story. One is you play as Claire Redfield and on your side you have Berry's daughter Moira Burton who was captured and taken into an abandoned island and they have to find a way out. On the other side, you play as Barry trying to find his daughter 6 months after their capture. It had some good parts in it, but I can’t see myself enjoying a second playthrough on it. It doesn’t help that you have to buy the rest of the story as DLC’s, which is just comedic. Imagine doing part of the story just to wait next week or so to buy and play another piece then to just wait again. It blows my mind they actually did that.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer is actually pretty fun. You have a Raid Mode (Just like in Revelations) and you get to level up your character and unlock perks for them. I actually had a blast with this on my Xbox and it still is fun here with friends. Not much to say about the multiplayer. It’s fun, the levels are fast to go through and can provide a challenge.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The campaign took me over 11 hours to beat. There are two endings I believe (I'm currently on my 2nd playthrough) so you do have some replayability, especially with easy achievements here (from what I saw). The Raid Mode will provide some extra time especially with a friend.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The voice acting is so good in this game. Everyone did their part so well and I’m happy to hear Barry again (it’s been so long). The music though, that’s a different story. The music score is probably one of the weakest in the franchise. It’s such a forgettable music score which sucls because I love the music in the Resident Evil games. Besides that, the sound effects are pretty good actually and the guns sound really nice. Also the enemies sounds scary which is a plus.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I didn’t have any horrible bugs in this game. I saw some enemies get stuck in some objects in the environment and it was pretty annoying to see. One thing that was annoying was the UI. It would close on me at some moments which was really odd. I did restart the game and it fixed the problem so if you get this, just follow that step.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]This game runs pretty well.I was able to max this game out no problem on my end. I would just suggest using a controller since I had some weird issues with input lag on mouse and keyboard.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]✔️Pro’s[/td]
        [td][list]
[*]Graphics are decent
[*]Lots of weapons to choose from
[*]Side characters are interesting
[*]Raid mode is really fun
[*]Awesome Locations

        [td]❌Con’s[/td]
        [td][list]
[*]UI is bad
[*]Story is forgettable
[*]Enemies are uninspiring
[*]Mouse controls are not the best
[*]Some boss fights are kinda meh
[*]Music is not that inspiring for a Resident Evil game.
[*]You have to buy episodes (basically buying pieces of the full game)
[/list]
[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]5/10
I would get this game on sale for 50% off (especially since you have to buy the episodes for the full experience).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This game felt like a let down compared to Resident Evil Revelations. The environments are cool, but it just felt like a cash crab for a Resident Evil game. Having to buy episodes is like buying a piece of the game. It’s such a silly idea Capcom did and doesn’t feel like a full experience even though I have all the DLC’s. The story was pretty boring and forgettable. The Raid Mode was fun though and really well done. I would only recommend this game if you are wanting to get all the Resident Evil games. You may enjoy it, but you are not missing much at all.[/td]

A abordagem em capítulo espantou muitas pessoas, mas na verdade ela agrega muito a direção artística do game. As referencias a kafka são bem utilizadas, os cenários são de bom gosto e coerentes ao tom do jogo com uma musica ambiente que mantem o bom gosto de trilhas sonoras da franquia. 

O maior ponto fraco é a IA, tirando isso, é uma aventura maravilhosa e traz uma Claire forte e experiente com uma aparência, tom de voz e resiliência emocional de acordo a uma ativista experiente contra bioterrorismo. O Desenvolvimento da personalidade de Moira pode ser facilmente notada no decorrer do game e eu adoraria ver seu retorno na franquia.

As a follow up to the well ported RE Revelations, it fills in all the gaps missing from the first one in terms of up-to-date game play mechanics and graphics. Along with carrying all the major hallmark elements associated with the RE franchise, the game is themed after Franz Kafka's writing so there are a lot of hidden literary references. 

There are a lot of complaints about the episodic nature of the game, but I found that to be a none issue and somewhat refreshing.

0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"Resident Evil Revelation 2 is a pretty interesting effort from Capcom to get back to live the franchise by developing an interesting story and characters and providing a smooth game play mechanics.
The only flaw on this game is the quality of the graphics and the soundtrack in some scenarios.
Overall rate: 8/10

Graphics: 6/10
This is one of weakest elements of this game. The graphics are not bad but could have been much better considering the PC capabilities.

Game play: 8/10
Game play is very smooth and intuitive. Shooting is very fun, as well as the possibility to change characters and adopt their skills/equipment depending on what the current situation in the game requires. However further optimization on your partner's AI is needed (when playing alone).

Story: 9/10
Story is interesting and is building up the suspense pretty good, additionally I love the fact they reference many quotes of Franz Kafka. Characters are pretty interesting and lovely in case of Natalia (she definitely steals the show with her charisma and voice personification).

Atmosphere: 8/10
Atmosphere could have been better, there are a lot of interesting settings and bizarre enemies, however the music was not matching the environment in most of the times (specially during the first two episodes).

Content: 10/10
For the price you pay, you will have a lot of fun and different ways to beat the game.

0,steam_reviews/287290_ResidentEvilRevelations2.json,23966,39,"Grimy, grungy, gross and uncomfortable in mostly the right ways.

Resident Evil as a series is a little unpredictable. For every good one, there are some real stinkers. This game therefore sits in a unique position of being a good game, with it's own stinker attached. Some take issue with the split campaign, and find one better than the other. I'm of the mind on the other hand that both are good, but both have a character that sucks to use, and the shifts between the two are the main cause of contention between the player and the game. This is mostly because of the games episodic structure -a trend I'm so glad we got out of- which pumps the breaks on each character right as things get interesting.

Here's the thing though, despite those facts, I think it's a really solid entry in the series for a few reasons. For one, the gameplay when playing as the attacker of the 2 characters feels good, it's derivative of Resident Evil 4, sure, but that game felt good to control and this one feels fine by extension. More importantly though, the story in this one feels pretty good by Resi standards. Sure it's as absurd as any Resident Evil, but it's of the fun, tries to be scary but ends up a weird mixture of camp but also unsettling just like Resident Evil 4 type. If you're beginning to notice a pattern, good, you've been paying attention. What I guess I'm getting at is that this game is pretty much Resident Evil 4 diet. It's not quite as good, but it's still fun, and if you want another good Resident Evil 4 type game, this one is pretty quality.

There is one last thing I should mention though, because it is so good. The aesthetics of this game are fantastic in looks, sound and general feel. The theme of the game is Kafka, and while it's not exactly as nuanced as that would imply, this means the narrative of the game involves not belonging, fear, pain and general isolation. The monsters are tremendously messed up and the environments are horribly run down and threatening. It's the kinda thing you feel like you need to take a shower and wrap yourself in a blanket after playing because it's just so miserable. To give you an idea of how much of this game's quality comes from it's bomb-ass designs, I'm giving them their own paragraph just to gush about how good they are. They take a normal Resident Evil 4 style game with it's unique mechanic debatably causing more harm than good, and bump it up to some high tier stuff. It enriches the story, gameplay and overall experience.

Pick it up if you want something like Resident Evil 4, but that isn't Resident Evil 4.",878,english

Die Atmosphäre verzaubert und die Soundkulisse rundet es ab.
Die Dynamik hat sich verschnellert da man jetzt Ausweichen manuell kann und die Gegner extrem aggro und schnell sind.
Die Modelle gefallen mir und vor allem die Anlehnung an Kafka.

Doch ein wenig erinnert es mich an The Evil Within und das ist nicht wirklich sooooo positiv....
Doch es ist Resident Evil und ich liebe die Serien einfach da ich ein großer Fan der Reihe bin.

ABER:
Als Liebhaber von Revelation 1 muss ich doch zugeben das es mich noch nicht richtig überzeugen konnte.
Der Itemshop im Spiel geht mal überhaupt nicht und den brauchten wir im 1. Teil auch nicht....
Und was ist das für ein WITZ mit dem Offline Koop?????
Steam preist an und Capcom verarscht seine Kunden weil es keinen für PC gibt und nur in einer kurzen Info zum Schluss beigefügt wurde. SAUEREI!!!!

Also wenn da nichts schnellstens kommt stürzt Revelation2 ganz schnell in den Keller und das wäre eigentlich schade.

0,steam_reviews/287980_MiniMetro.json,13557,1,"Although I've played it a fair bit over the past few days, I can't fully recommend Mini Metro.

It uses the theme of a subway and subway map, but the experience of drawing subway lines doesn't feel close to that. 
New nodes pop up sort of randomly and every day the subway gets a little busier, until a single station gets overcrowded. The mechanics, such as not being able to cross your own tracks, except at a station, and the fact that every train *must* stop at each connected station, make it hard to recreate traditional subway lay-outs, such as local vs. express trains. 

In the end, Instead of a making a system that's easily navigable, you're optimising it for mathematical constraints, and often end up with a sytem that's incredibly gerrymandered and Kafkaesque, rather than something a sane person would want to navigate.

The result is that  during too few moments do you feel that you're running a public transport system, even in the abstract. It ends up a, somewhat interesting, puzzler where you're trying to optimise for mathematical constraints with a little ""transport sauce"" poured over it. 

Although the various maps have their own little quirks, almost none of them display true character, nor do the differences affect gameplay much, with possibly the exception of Osaka, where you get the use of ""Shinkansen"" trains. As a result, as it is, Metro Mini hardly makes a difference  playing London, Sao Paulo or any other city. You could just as well be playing on some randomly-generated map.

All-in-all: an abstract puzzler with some limited appeal, but best avoided if you want some semblance of realism.

Overall: 5/10
The designers should've either gone for more realism, or ditch all the references to real-life and keep it a fully abstract puzzler. Now fans of neither genre get what they could have had.",271,english

0,steam_reviews/292030_TheWitcher3WildHunt.json,708617,3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an outstanding masterpiece that has captivated gamers worldwide with its immersive storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and deep gameplay mechanics. Developed by CD Projekt Red, this action role-playing game takes players on a grand adventure as Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter known as a Witcher.

Main Storyline:
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt boasts a gripping narrative that keeps players engaged from to finish.

The depth of the storytelling is exceptional, offering players a sense of agency as their decisions shape the world and its inhabitants.

The Beauty of Toussaint:
One of the game´s most remarkable features is the region of Toussaint, introduced in the ""Blood and Wine"" expansion. Toussaint is a breathtaking land characterized by rolling vineyards, picturesque landscapes, and a vibrant atmosphere. The attention to detail is astonishing, with the region boasting stunning architecture, lush forests, and sun-soaked fields that create a truly immersive experience.

Gaunter O´Dimm, also know as the Man of Glass or Master Mirror, is a character introduced in the game´s ""Hearts of Stone"" expansion. He is an enigmatic and malevolent force who grants wishes at a price. The genius lies in the writing and design of this character, as Gaunter O´Dimm is a master manipulator who always seems one step ahead. His chilling presence, impeccable voice acting, and devilish charm make him one of the most memorable and intriguing characters in gaming history.

Heart of Stone: A Kafkaesque Atmosphere:
The ""Heart of Stone"" expansion introduces players to the dark and mysterious realm of Oxenfurt, which evokes a palpable sense of unease and dread. The amtosphere is reminiscent of the works of Franz Kafka, with its twisted logic, moral ambiguity, and eerie ambiance. The expansion weaves a captivating tale involving a cursed character named Olgierd von Everec, whose tragic past and Faustian pact with Gaunter O´Dimm serve as the foundation for a deeply unsettling experience

This adds a layer of depth to gameplay, allowing players to customize Geralt's equipment to suit their playstyle. Alchemy, in particular, plays a crucial role as players can brew powerful potions, bombs, and other concoctions that grant temporary enhancements during combat.

Gwent: Gwent is a popular card game within the game's universe and has gained a dedicated following among players. It offers a strategic and addictive gameplay experience, as players collect cards, build powerful decks, and engage in intense matches against various opponents throughout the game world. Gwent tournaments and quests centered around the card game provide a fun and rewarding diversion from the main storyline.

Vast and Living Open World: The open-world of The Witcher 3 is vast, diverse, and filled with detail. It is a living, breathing world that reacts to Geralt's actions and choices. From bustling cities to war-torn villages and untamed wilderness, every location is meticulously designed and visually stunning. The world feels alive, with dynamic weather systems, day-night cycles, and NPCs that have their own schedules and routines.

Breathtaking Visuals: The game's visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations is remarkable. From the sprawling landscapes to the smallest of details, the game showcases stunning graphics that immerse players in a visually stunning world. Whether it's the sunsets over Toussaint or the haunting atmosphere of a dark forest, the visuals enhance the overall gaming experience.

Deep and Rewarding Gameplay: The gameplay mechanics in The Witcher 3 are deep and rewarding. The combat system is skill-based and offers a variety of weapons, magic abilities, and tactical options. Players can customize Geralt's skills, upgrade his equipment, and utilize alchemy to prepare potions and bombs. The game strikes a balance between challenging encounters and player progression, ensuring a satisfying and immersive gameplay experience.

Player Agency and Consequences: The Witcher 3 puts a significant emphasis on player choice and consequences. The decisions made throughout the game have far-reaching impacts on the story, characters, and the game world itself.

Una mañana, tras un sueño intranquilo, Gregorio Samsa se despertó convertido en
un monstruoso insecto. Estaba echado de espaldas sobre un duro caparazón y, al alzar la
cabeza, vio su vientre convexo y oscuro, surcado por curvadas callosidades, sobre el que
casi no se aguantaba la colcha, que estaba a punto de escurrirse hasta el suelo. Numerosas
patas, penosamente delgadas en comparación con el grosor normal de sus piernas, se
agitaban sin concierto.
- ¿Qué me ha ocurrido?
No estaba soñando. Su habitación, una habitación normal, aunque muy pequeña,
tenía el aspecto habitual. Sobre la mesa había desparramado un muestrario de paños -
Samsa era viajante de comercio-, y de la pared colgaba una estampa recientemente
recortada de una revista ilustrada y puesta en un marco dorado. La estampa mostraba a
una mujer tocada con un gorro de pieles, envuelta en una estola también de pieles, y que,
muy erguida, esgrimía un amplio manguito, asimismo de piel, que ocultaba todo su
antebrazo.
Gregorio miró hacia la ventana; estaba nublado, y sobre el cinc del alféizar
repiqueteaban las gotas de lluvia, lo que le hizo sentir una gran melancolía.
«Bueno –pensó–; ¿y si siguiese durmiendo un rato y me olvidase de todas estas
locuras?» Pero no era posible, pues Gregorio tenía la costumbre de dormir sobre el lado
derecho, y su actual estado no le permitía adoptar tal postura. Por más que se esforzara
volvía a quedar de espaldas. Intentó en vano esta operación numerosas veces; cerró los
ojos para no tener que ver aquella confusa agitación de patas, que no cesó hasta que notó
en el costado un dolor leve y punzante, un dolor jamás sentido hasta entonces.",8096,spanish

0,steam_reviews/292930_BlackMirrorI.json,1101,1,"Really want to give this game a good review based on its story and atmosphere... on what it could have been, mainly. There aren't really any gothic horror point-and-clicks kicking about - and if you're a fan of Poe, or Lovecraft the novelty value just drag you through the game. Some people seem to really dig it.

However, in all honesty, Black Mirror is one of the most irritatingly designed adventure games I've played and I've played a lot of them.  The amount of time I've spent playing the game is vast, but also unrepresentative in terms of value, because the game actively revels in wasting your time. Characters speak and move at a snails pace. Te gameplay is pedantic, forcing  you backtrack constantly. So much of it is an infuriating pixel hunt. You have no ability to explore environments at your leisure, rather you must... look at this items, before talking to this person about said item, before talking to another person about a point of conversation... before the game might decide to let you pick up an item it took you hours to even notice in the first place.

One part of the game involves an old lady telling you to tell her gardener to fix a doorbell. He eventually gumpily acquiesces. She then says he's to cut the grass instead. You ferry that message. He says no. You go back to the old lady and she insists. You convey her insistence... Jesus Christ, it sounds amusingly Kafkaesque but it's straight tedious.

The puzzling is scant and unsatisfying. I eventually abandoned the game altogether after one puzzle expected me to know (off the top of my head) what the symbols of the zodiac look like and what order they appear in the calendar... in order to complete a slider puzzle. Nah, blood. 

Shout out to the voice acting, too, which is genuinely some of the worst you'll ever hear. The main protagonist sounds like a haughty, slightly retarded sat nav...  now left broken in a kitchen basin with only dregs of power in its cells. A local pub featured in one section of the game features a laughable mashup of Scaw'ish/Oirish/Mockney accents that causes the game lurch headlong into the cringeworthy.  The're a little Oliver Twist boy and when your character interacts with him... the patter sounds like it's been lifted from To Catch a Predator, or a parody of Pennywise The Clown in a storm drain.

Actually, I hate this game. Writing this has helped me come to terms with that fact. Disappointing.

In greater depth, let's get this out of the way first--yes, this game is *gorgeous.* Not just in terms of its commendable graphical prowess, but in terms of its visual presentation. Its labyrinthine levels are sumptuously designed and evocative, somewhere between City 17 and Giorgio de Chirico. 

The writing isn't as bad as some of the other reviews have made it sound--the game definitely feels pretentious, and it has some pacing issues, but if you can look past that, there's an interesting (if heavy-handed) meditation on futility and truth to be found here--very Kafka-Lite. The best bits are definitely the ancillary notes and text posted around the game's environment, which represent the views of people who've lived in the game's mysterious environment and struggled with the miserable emptiness of it. 

Unfortunately, the narrator you're saddled with spends most of the game as the sort of nihilistic, dull teenager who just discovered Nietzsche and wants to sound important. It's not a dealbreaker--like all good fictional characters, he undergoes a change as the story goes along--but it definitely drags down what feels like a thoughtful experience into something that feels pedantic and not half as smart as it thinks it is.

All told, though, if you like walking simulators, thought-provoking narratives and environmental storytelling, it's easy to look past the narration and enjoy The Old City.",110,english

Let me paint you a picture. I'm sitting in my living room playing “Lovely Planet” for review purposes and junk. It's pretty adorable; that's my first impression. I'm running around a world that could easily be confused with “Katamari Damacy,” shooting little red squares and pins, rushing to reach the pink and purple flagpole that signifies the end of each short burst of a level. With every victory I'm shown my time, accuracy, and the stars I've earned. I finish each level in a few seconds... at first. 

As I progress this cute little game takes a sinister turn. Suddenly I have to deal with innocent geometric dudes I can't shoot, platforms that disappear should I linger a moment too long, and giant apples I have to shoot before they hit the ground - all while bouncing and dodging (and screaming curse words so vile and bizarre that they haven't been conjured up, not in this plane of existence, anyway. Only in “Lovely Planet”).

Remember that level in “Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare?” I think it was called “Mile High Club” or something punny. Yeah, this whole damn game is that level. There are no screw ups, no second chances. I've never clutched a controller so tightly, a fact made all the more disturbing because I'm playing a game with a color scheme straight out of the Teletubby-verse. 

Those with weak constitutions should avoid this title as the catchy music and rainbow explosion background will literally drive you to slavering madness as it mocks you; taunts you. You'll replay any given level a dozen times, each death increasingly unfair to you. Your shouts of disbelief will slowly transform into maniacal, sobbing laughter as you come to realize you're the devil and sinner in this Kafkaesque Hell of your own making. And finally, with victory nearly in your desperate, grasping reach, your sweat-slicked hands will betray you and you'll fall to your death. 

And then you'll click retry. ""Lovely Planet"" is endearing, unapologetic in its challenge, and fun to play. This game has heart and charm usually absent in your standard 'tough as nails' fare, and it is a refreshing change of pace. For twitch gameplay enthusiasts and fans of the wonderfully weird, I can't recommend ""Lovely Planet"" enough.",90,english

Ich kann aber nicht behaupten dass ich verstanden habe was man in diesem Werk von mir wollte.
Und ich fürchte das wird einigen Anderen auch so gehen. 

""The Stanley Parable"" war eine Geschichte zwischen mir als Spieler und dem Erzähler. Ich war mit einbezogen, deshalb war es unterhaltsam. In diesem Spiel hier bekomme ich nur eine Geschichte erzählt über zwei Personen die ich nicht kenne. Das hat mich aber nicht gepackt da ich diesmal nicht persönlich betroffen war. 
Das Werk ist quasi ein Hörbuch. Der interaktive spielerische Teil ist nicht der Rede wert obwohl manche der Level vom künstlerischen Standpunkt gesehen durchaus interessant sind.

Deshalb kann ich es auch nicht ruhigen Gewissens jedem empfehlen.

Das soll nicht heißen dass das Werk Mist ist. Wer auf Kunst und Philosophie steht der wird hier evtl seinen Spaß haben.

Mich als passiver Zuhörer tangiert die Story eher peripher wie es so schön heißt.
Wer Spaß am herumphilosophieren hat und auf Sachen wie Kafka steht der wird hier womöglich auf seine Kosten kommen.

Ich erkenne an dass der Author wohl eine ernste Absicht verfolgt und das ganze Konzept auch recht originell ist. Das ist auch der Grund warum ich nach den 1,5 h Spielzeit keinen Refund beantragt habe.

- Achtung ggf. Spoiler -

Salopp formuliert läuft man die ganze Zeit (oft ziemlich lange) durch langweilige und unfertige Spielefragmente und bekommt von Davey erzählt was sich Coda wohl bei diesem oder jenem Detail gedacht haben möge. Und am Ende bekommen die beiden Krach weil er Coda offenbar falsch eingeschätzt hat, in seinen Spielen rumgepfuscht hat und diese dann auch noch der Öffentlichkeit zeigt was Coda nie wollte.

Und nach dem Ende dachte ich mir nur so ""...und jetzt ?""

0,steam_reviews/303210_TheBeginnersGuide.json,18815,4,"The Beginner's Guide is a compelling and interesting journey into the mind of a video game developer which I would recommend especially to those who like ""alternative"" games such as The Stanley Parable (obviously), Her Story and To The Moon etc but more broadly to fans of the media in general.

The actual narrative of the game involves Davey Wreden (the creator of the Stanley Parable) taking us on a guided journey through a particularly meaningful relationship of his. This relationship is between himself and a perhaps fictional developer called ""Coda"" and our journey involves experiencing these games in the order of their creation and noticing how their progression (or regression) reflects both upon Codas skill as a game designer and his ongoing relationship with the narrator (Wreden).

So the games give us insight into the mind of ""Coda"" as well as Davey, their relationship and the creative process in general. One thing I will say as someone who has suffered from depression was that I found the game quite upsetting due to the Kafka-esque (the term is relevant here I swear) nature of some of Coda's games and his seemingly nihilistic attitude to life in general. So it could be quite ""triggering"" or confronting for those of us who struggle with positivity generally.

Although perhaps not quite as awesome as the narrator of the Stanley Parable, Davey Wreden is a very interesting and engaging narrator and had me fully engaged in Coda (whether or not he really exists) and their relationship.

Not to be captain obvious here, but the game has no lose conditions or meaningful puzzles of any kind so if you are looking for Call of Duty 99 best look elsewhere. Overall I found the game made me actually think about game developers,  artistic creation itself and the plight of depressed people so as an experience I highly recommend it.",210,english

What a game! Such atmosphere!

I play video games since a long time. I started on Videopac in the 80's at 6 years old and never stopped, so I may be a bit ""blasé"" at times. I had my eyes on this game since a long time but the reviews put me off quite a bit because they didn't do it justice: ""lovecartian horror"" they said, grindy they said... 

Don't get me wrong I like lovecraft as much as the next person, but, well, let me tell you it is much more than that. It is weird fantasy done right, surrealism done right, interactive fiction done right, rogue-lik(t)e done right, post-dwarf fortress done right. 

Failbetter takes you for an exploratory ride in the murky waters of the soul and spirit here, the ""horror of too much sense at once"", the queer, weird, violant, deep, arachnean, psychotic, scorpion, plutonian, yin energy. But you also taste the non-sense, perverse, martian, sunny, yang energy: THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN! ^^ 

The premise? 
A Victorian Era London was stollen by Bats and is now...underground. You managed to buy a ship and are now ready to answer the call of the zee. 
I won't say more...

Weird fantasy and other ""underground"" genres take their roots in the 19th century poetry, romanticism, naturalism and expressionism and Failbetter knows it: Mary Shelley, Maupassant's last works (La Nuit, La Peur, Le Horla etc...), Theophile Gauthier (Le Roman de la Momie, Spirite) Poe (wich was translated by Charles Baudelaire here in France), Nietzche, Dostoïevsky, the eery poetry of Emily Dickinson and even later, HG Wells (The Island of Doctor Moreau, Invisible Man, The Crystal Egg short story) can prefigure what Lovecraft wil devellop in his time, while dada, surrealism, ewpressionism and existentialism is flourishing in pre and post war Europe with Jarry, Buffet, Breton, Schiele, Munch, Sartre, Camus etc etc... 

Social criticism was and is a big part of these eras and genres and Social criticism plays also a big part in Sunless Sea. It doesn't land flat on its face like many Lovecraftian works do (the best hommage to Lovecraft in my opinion is Borges short story in Aleph, ""There are more things...""(Indeed there are, or maybe not... who knows? ^^) 

But Failbetter knows we're in the 21st century, they know underground 19th-20th century litterature from Dostoïevsky to Palaniuk via Bukowsky and Kafka, they know of Roger Caillois and Mathieu Triclos and the different game theories, they know about Dwarf Fortress, they know chaos theory and that information is a mess and there is a lot of post-modern irony and light witticism thrown in the mix wich prevent the game to take itself too seriously and fall in the trap so many others fall into these days: Heaviness, seriousness, greyishness, brownishness (seriously the last 15 years gave me zombi and brown nausea, blasé vous dis-je ^^) ... 

Yes, you are exploring anguish, the price of joy, death's door, and the different horrors that lie under the surface. Yes each run make you feel stress and hope for the safe waters of fallen london but it knows... It knows of the great joke, of the masquerade and it lets you have a taste of it, to explore it, to laugh with it. Well it knows that it doesn't really know in fact (or does it?)... Maybe it doesn't know a thing of what I talk about but I don't care, I love the game ^^ 
I am confused now, must be the red honey... ^^

If you like the idea of entering and exploring a world you don't understand, if you like stories, weird fantasy, surrealism, rôle play, reading in general then this game is for you. You will laugh in Sunless Sea too! The writing is superb and diverse. The atmosphere is great and different in each part of the zee and soundtrack and sound design is not too invasive, it pulls you in enough but does not distract you too much from reading or feeling the game. I personnally love the aesthetic and gameplay choices, a bit minimalistic but with a personality, it works really really well.... And it works on pretty humble computers too, so kudos for that...

Gameplay wise, I like it, it can feel a bit grindy and repetetive due to difficulty and starting over and over but it is a big part of what is good in Sunless Sea: You will have zee fever, you will want to go out at zee and uncover its secrets, you will panic, laugh, succeed but most often die trying. This game managed to make me take a pen to take notes on what to do next, etc... In an era of social networks and wikis that's an achievement...

Go check out Fallen London, the browser game, wich set the universe Sunless Sea is based from, playing the two simultaneously is a pretty good experience. 
I have many more things to do in Sunless Sea, and i already have a good 50 hours put in. It was like finding a good book for me, wich is rare, same for games... 

I bought Sunless Skies too (thank you for the discounts, by the way, I heard it is a bit less grindy, so I'll go for it if i feel bored with Sunless Sea) and waiting for Mask of the roses. Well done Failbetter and thank you for this Craft of Love ;) 

PS: If you have the money, buy it full price, eyes closed, it is well well worth it!",4179,english
0,steam_reviews/304650_SUNLESSSEA.json,8697,4,"What is it?
In Sunless Sea you are a captain of a ship, travelling on the titular underground ocean. You steer the ship from a top down perspective and travel from islands and cities to one another, exploring the sea and sometimes fighting pirates and sea monsters. When docking in a harbor, the game changes to some sort of text adventure, where you have to decide what to to using your abilities and/or cargo to have more options or better chances to be successful.. There is also trading involved, and some RPG-elements, as both your captain and your ship have various stats, which you can improve and officers, which you can recruit. Terror is a very important game play mechanic: When traveling on the sea or making certain decision, your terror rises. If it rises too much, bad things happen, options disappear (but new might come instead). Too high terror means too high risk of death. Reducing terror can be very costly, depending where on the sea you are.

What genre is this?
I'd say Lovecraft meets Steampunk with a little Kafka and mythology. If you have played their browser game ""Fallen London"", it belongs in that universe. There is no real main story, but many stories parallel, e.g. most of your officers have their own story, and several of the islands. While you might die from time to time, and your next captain can inherit various belongings or stats, it is not really a roguelike: Often there is luck involved, but seldom in a game deciding way. When you get the hang of it and play rather cautious, you do not need to die at all. The position of the island changes from game to game.

How does it look and sound?
This qualifies as an Indie game. Graphics are very dark and atmospherical, sometimes gruesome. The topdown view is simple but mostly well-arranged, in the ""text adventure"" mode you have pictures, which again catch the atmosphere very well. There are very few tracks, but they fit the overall theme. There is no voiceacting.

Game length?
This is my main criticism: The game is great, but once you got the hang of it, it gets really, really tedious. Let me give you an example: According to the games wiki, the best trade route nets you 13 Echo (the games currency) per traded item for which you have to travel most of the map, and the ships are not very fast. The largest ship can carry a maximum of 100 items, but you need at least a third for fuel and provisions to not die. You do not have a warehouse anywhere, so you have to carry everthing with you (eg quest items, munitions, candles) all the time. Let's be very optimistic (or take a big risk) and say, you can use half of the hold for your trade good. That means from this trade run you can get 650 - ignoring the fact that you have to buy fuel and food and maybe hire crew and somehow have to reduce terror. And that you need the biggest ship for it, which costs 29 000.
Let me say it in another way: You have to grind for money and stats, and these grinds take very, very, very, very long. The whole pacing feels like that they gonna railroad you with microtransactions, time saver dlcs and premium content any second. They do not, however.
On the plus side, the game can be modded and it is easy to edit your savegames.

TLDR?
Fresh concept, awesome setting. Many, albeit small wall of texts. Getting from A to B takes very long and you have to get from many As to many Bs very, very often. Even for a little progress you have to invest a lot of real time (and make notes). If you are not botherd by this and have lots of free time (or are willing to edit your saves), it is a great game. 7/10",2672,english

E saranno molto facili, grazie anche alla possibilità di usare degli aiuti. Molto simile a “The Franz Kafka Videogame” come struttura.  (Occhio che i puzzles però sono completamente diversi.)

Mi ha sorpreso come la trama sia ben strutturata in un gioco dove rappresenta solo il pretesto per presentare i propri enigmi.

- The tutorial is one of the worstI have seen: It's far to quick, makes no pause for reading, explains little and especially not even explains all mechanics.
- There is no difficulty setting, there is no gamespeed setting.
- Certain mechanics feel like they were just added for artificial difficulty, espcially the darkness just makes the game harder without adding any deepness.

Et puis. Qu'on demande aux gens ce qu'ils font de la vie, ils entreront dans mille autres banalités, mille détails insignifiants. 

Les petits hommes font des grands discours et les grands discours font de petits hommes ; les petits hommes qui s'expriment partout là où ils ne font rien ; les petits hommes qui invoquent la vie là où ils ne l'assument pas, c'est-à-dire là où ils ne vont jamais, ne voyant ni ne comprenant rien de l'étrangeté, ne la saisissant que par des paroles simplifiées ; moralités condensées, réalité confisquée. Réalité de l'étrangeté... 

... La dire, c'est une chose ; la faire sentir, c'en est une autre. Et, même, la faire sentir par le moyen d'un jeu vidéo, c'est encore autre chose. La sentir, c'est quoi, c'est s'admettre impuissant, démuni face aux choses de la vie ; c'est consentir à ne rien sentir d'explicable. C'est sentir sans rien dire. 

Ecoutez. Deux jours en arrière. J'écoutais Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, peinard, assis sur une chaise : la cruauté, disait-il, c'est prendre plaisir à infliger la douleur ; être cruel avec un autre, au fond, c'est agir à l'""animaliser""... Oh bien sûr, imaginez tout ce que véhicule en arrière-pensées ce petit discours d'un historien qui se vit comme scientifique. L'important, ici, ce n'est pas ce qu'il dit, c'est plutôt ce qu'il ne dit pas : son sentimentalisme. Tous ses épanchements de sentiments comme autant de façons de faire de la morale sans le reconnaître. Tous ces mots sans consistance prononcés par un homme à qui les pieds de la chaise sur laquelle il repose compensent une asymétrie par des pages de morale, resserrées et finalement utilisées comme des cales ; enlevez-lui ses appuis, ses certitudes, ses croyances, et il risquerait de tomber ; il tient en équilibre au-dessus d'un gouffre. 

Et ce gouffre, devinez, c'est l'étrangeté de la vie. Life is strange. Je vous parlais de la faire sentir ; un jeu vidéo, c'est un bon moyen d'y parvenir. Mais ce grand moyen appelle des moyens plus petits, des moyens de confection, de fabrication. Raoul Barbet et Michel Koch, les créateurs, renoncèrent d'abord à raconter leur histoire dans un monde tout à fait vraisemblable. Maxine Caulfield, l'héroïne, peut remonter le temps... L'étrange commence par là. Et cette formule de Kundera qui convient : ""La frontière de l'invraisemblable n'est plus surveillée"". Formule adressée à son maître, Kafka, certes ; mais je lui redonne une place, ici, à une différente adresse ; car Life is Strange a laissé la frontière sans surveillance, il est au-delà du vraisemblable... 

...""Ainsi que la plupart des jeux vidéo"", me répondrait-on. Oui. Non. A Kundera d'ajouter : ""Plus on observe attentivement, obstinément, une réalité, mieux on comprend qu'elle ne réponde pas à l'idée que tout le monde s'en fait"". Et pour observer, encore faut-il le pouvoir ; encore faut-il déchirer le ""rideau de la pré-interprétation"", le voile des présupposés ; un voile tissé de mythes, de légendes cousues entre elles et que des siècles de culture et de morale ont fait tenir entre nous et le monde. 

Life is Strange percute justement la morale, les conventions, déchire en partie le rideau. Les grands principes vacillent, au premier rang duquel : l'intérêt général... L'étrange se termine par là. Sur la blessure d'un corps sans chair : le bien commun. Max Caulfield peut agir sur le temps, sur les événements, avec la même distance d'un être divin ; Dieu est mort, Max est vivante. Et avec elle, ce qu'elle comprend du monde, puis ce qu'elle en retient : son intérêt pour une amie, Chloe Price, son intérêt motivé par les affects.

Les affects... Tout ce qui agite la chair, tout ce qui anime les corps ; tout le vrai, tout le beau, tout l'étrange. Laissez dire les juges, les donneurs de leçons ; laissez dire que des causes supérieures surpassent les causes individuelles ; laissez dire que l'humanité manque partout où le choix personnel prime sur la cause commune ; laissez dire ""cruel"", ""égoïste"", ""sans coeur"" ; vos juges ont toujours eu cette manie de ne pas voir le coeur là où il est et de le voir là où il n'est pas.    

Max. Jeune femme. Jeune coeur. Jeune étudiante effacée dans un établissement de prestige, haut lieu de compétition. La pression. Et le doute. Et la peur. De la société. Des autres. Et le doute, encore. Et l'inquiétude, toujours. Et l'incapacité d'être à la mesure des autres. Et le manque de confiance en soi. Et la timidité. Et la moquerie. Et la honte. C'est quelque chose, hein ; c'est à vous rendre névrotique ; c'est à vous mettre dans le besoin. 

Besoin de réconfort. Besoin de réponses. Besoin de raisons. Et ses raisons, Max ne les trouve pas à l'école, pas dans les cours, pas dans les leçons, pas dans les pas des autres. Son éducation est une éducation par le sentiment, une formation par les affects, par les passions. 

Le jeu débute ainsi : Max fait un rêve prémonitoire : dans quatre jours, une tempête dévastera sa ville natale. Deux grandes possibilités pour le joueur s'affrontent tout au long du jeu, au-delà des intrigues secondaires, au-delà du reste : se soumettre à l'ordre des choses ou le changer, s'en remettre au désordre de ses passions ; se soumettre au bien commun ou permettre son bien personnel ; se résigner à souffrir ou se débarrasser du poids moral qui pèse au sentiment. Vivre couché ou vivre debout. 

Vivre debout, c'est subvertir ; c'est agir à renverser l'ordre des choses. C'est donc remonter le temps, influencer son déroulement. Vivre debout, de cette manière, c'est essentiellement assumer des conséquences ; c'est être une cause. La tempête frappera. 

Vivre couché, c'est l'inverse ; c'est ne pas assumer d'être une cause ; c'est, au contraire, obéir à une cause placée au-dessus de soi. C'est renoncer à son intérêt, à ses passions, à sa volonté individuelle. C'est vivre pour le bien commun, pour une vague idée générale. C'est s'abandonner en silence aux règles du jeu, sans tricher, sans toucher l'ordre. La tempête se dissipera.

La tempête est la menace qui pousse le joueur à faire des choix ; elle le conduit à être arbitre des différentes importances, contraint de choisir dans l'équivalence des choses. Les gens moraux s'en serviront comme d'une excuse pour se justifier de ne pas vivre pour soi ; ""il y a des priorités"", diront-ils, ""l'intérêt de la communauté passe avant l'intérêt personnel"". L'oubli les enterrera. 

Les autres, les gens pleins de vie, ceux qui, pour reprendre un mot de Max Stirner (un autre Max), n'ont basé leur cause sur rien, ceux qui s'assument eux-mêmes comme étant des causes, des matières à désirs emportées par la nécessité, ceux-là sont convaincus des bienfaits qu'apporte la tempête : elle restaure sa parole à l'étrangeté, son expression jusqu'alors comprimée, frappée de mutisme par les conventions sociales, les règles, les codes, etc, la panoplie des bâillons, des obligations ; outils de malheur. C'est trop pour soi de vivre avec ce que l'on hait ; il faut se révolter.  

La tempête est alors une délivrance. Ecrasant une ville, détruisant sa toile d'obligations, les choses regagnent le relief et la couleur que tenaient à l'invisibilité les réglementations, les droits à la marge et aux névroses. Max pourrait ainsi retrouver sa visibilité ; les causes de ses malheurs emportées, elle pourrait être la cause ; elle pourrait dire : ""Je n'ai basé ma cause sur rien ; je suis moi-même la cause"". Elle pourrait consentir à vivre, à charger de souvenirs les souffrances vécues, à les convertir en raisons d'agir pour soi. Agir avant de mourir.",9200,french

Die liebevoll gezeichnete Comicwelt in gedeckten Tönen wirkt nicht nur gekonnt, sondern auch schlüssig. Auch die Soundunterlegung paßt genau und läßt uns in diese irgendwie andere, fast kindlich-kafkaeske Welt, die uns aber dennoch vertraut ist, eintauchen. 

Sehr schade, daß das ganze kostenlose Spiel nur etwa eine Viertelstunde dauert. Gerne hätte man länger in dieser Welt verweilt, gerne hätte man weiter gerätselt, gerne hätte man dem plumpen Wesen weiter auf seinem Wege geholfen.

At first glance this seems like an innocent indie game concept gone awry, but a second look quickly reveals the Kafkaesque allegories underneath the thin veil. What many players fail to realize is that this entire game is a dystopian view on the reliance many quantum physicists hold on the famous thought experiment, Schrodinger’s Cat. Bad Rats shows, with horrifyingly accuracy, the future of study in physics.

As man-kind grows nearer and nearer to unlocking the secrets of the quantum world, the thought experiment will hinder progress more and more. Bad Rats shows the feline genocide that will soon follow upon the completion of the grand unified theory, for with the paradox of Schrodinger's Cat ever looming within the minds of our greatest physicists, they will resort to running every possible scenario of cat death and life until every possibility is statistically accounted for. With string theory becoming more and more accepted this means that the possibilities are theoretically endless, which the game alludes to in the unforgiving Expert Mode.

Bad Rats is not an example of bad game design. It is a message. It is a warning. Above all else, it is a mission. To warn us all of the impending doom science will wrought upon us. With the united world pouring every resource and man available into research of cat death probability, incessant matter farming for industrial cat cloning and feline teleportation, we will no doubt drive our species to extinction. Our own hubris will very well be our down-fall.

Trust in the Bad Rats, we are not meant to unlock the secrets of the universe.",634,english

I saw a video game... a 1 dollar steam game that, though simple as it seemed, changed me... changed my being, changed who I am... Made me who I am...

Enlightened me...

The game, Bad Rats, the game was new... no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since... since coming into existence... and there it was before me on screen, I saw it... a video game... What was it called?

Bad Rats.

The story here is of a cat, a plain cat. He is an orange cat, but he is more than that... I will get to this later, but first let us say that he's a cat, a plain cat.

And then there are rats... Bad Rats.

This is the nature of the world, here. When I see the world, the politics, the future, the... the satellites in space, and... the people who put them there...

You can look at everything as rats and a cat... two beings, in harmony and at war...

So, this game I saw; this cat, an orange cat, and the rats, bad rats, you see...

Yes... hmm...

It is about everything. This... video game is, oh, lo and behold... not so little anymore.

So yes, when I was 18, I saw this game... and it hit me all at once, its power. I bought it, and every day, I looked at it, and I said ""Okay... let me look at this here. What is this doing to me? Why is this so powerful?""

This orange cat, sits quietly in solitude... waiting... he looks up pondering his existence... in some sort of trance...

Then these rats, oh so little delicate rats initiate a plan... Through cooperation they work to achieve a common goal... A metaphor for civilization as we know it...

Now what could those rats be up to?

This... I always come to this, because I was a young man... I'm older now, and I still don't have the secrets, the answers, so this question still rings true, the cat looks up and he thinks...

Now what could those rats be up to?

It is a profound question.

Why am I here? What is my purpose? It is reflection and self-examination here. It is facing the dust, the misery of a cold, careless universe. You can feel the weight of it...

And then it happens... You see it, you see... it's almost like divine intervention, suddenly it is there, and it overpowers you...

A cat is hit by an anvil.

It is the rat's anvil,  it's the Bad Rat's anvil, but the cat... this cat, an orange cat, is hit by the anvil... and from afar, and someplace near, but not clear... near but not clear... The rats become victorious...

But, let's take a step back... let us examine this from all sides, all perspectives...

One imagines the author, Invent4 Entertainment, teetering on the edge of insanity... their rationality, their lucidity, hovering over the void... and they seek the truth.

You can see it in the quality of the graphics; the thoughtful, controlled meshes mixed with the... occasional, chaotic models at work in the shadows and cat's dark stripes.

It's almost as if the bad rats are chaos themselves.

Yes, they are the embodiment of chaos, disorder, hatred, fear... Thievery, death, destruction, desolation!

The cat gets hit with the anvil.

The cat gets hit with the anvil.

This scene resonates within me. This one scene causes me to wonder, I always look back on it, like the light at the end of a tunnel.

One recalls the great existential forces in literature... Camus' Meursalt, Kafka's Gregor Samsa, or Sartre's Antoine Roquentin... the cat sees the hopelessness of life, which...ah, yes...

This is why Invent4 Entertainment has chosen the anvil. It represents a recklessness, a... a disregard for what some would define as the beauty of life. The cat may die from the impact, he may not... He defies life; he sits defiant, saying nothing, but looking as if he could say... ""Then let me die... it does not matter.""

It does not matter.

The death animation centers the issue, and again, this hearkens to many of the great religious works of art.

I'm talking about the rat game in relation to religion. It's... it's interesting to assign the roles of God... and anti-God, or, as many know him to be, the devil... or on a much larger scale, simply the forces of... good and evil. The bad rats, the mischievous, evil and malicious... He is the devil, and note, the two forms of the cat; the cat before death, still innocent, still draped in the... delight, of the lack of knowledge. He is... the humans in the Garden of Eden. He feels for his hope... but he has yet to eat from the tree... and the rats, the sinister serpent... and notice, notice how Invent4 Entertainment has framed this... The cat during death is locked in a struggle, between his innocence, and his knowledge of the truth... knowledge of the existence of evil.

It is stunning. The great struggle, the struggle that transcends time... and Invent4 Entertainment floats over all this, as creator... the God, of sorts, in his own right.

The game itself transcends any spiritual means... it has some sort of an enigma... Some sort of perplexing mystery...

These are universal proportions. I don't know... how best to explain why it works, I've studied the Bad Rats game, and analyzed the rat's and the cat's proportions against several universal mathematical constants.

E, Pi, the Golden Ratio, the Feigenbaum Constants, and so on... and it's surprising... scary even, how things align. You can take just... tiny pieces of the cutscenes, for instance, take the cat's elbow from the second level... and take that, and project it back over the cat's entire shape in the third level, and you'll see a near perfect Fibonacci sequence emerge...

It's eerie to me... and it makes you wonder if you're in the presence of a deity, if there is some larger hand at work...

There's no doubt in my mind that the maker of Bad Rats is a smart man...

Invent4 Entertainment is capable of anything to me... They are remarkable, but this is so far beyond that, I think we might see that... this work of art is revered and respected in years to come.

Everything about it is perfect. I can only describe it as a miracle creation, something came together... the elements aligned... It is like the comets, the cosmic orchestra that is up there over your head... The immense, enormous void is working all for one thing, to tell you one thing...

Gas and rock, and purity, and nothing.

I will say this... When I see the rat game... and I mean every single time I look at the visuals, the colors, the shapes that make up the one dollar steam game...

I see perfection.

Do I find perfection in many things?

Some things, I would say... Some things are perfect... and this is one of them. I can look at the little tuft of hair on the Bat Rat... it is the perfect shade... The red dynamite on the suicide bomber rat... How could a mere mortal even MAKE this?

Invent4 Entertainment is possibly a new master of the craft, a... a genius of the eye; they very well may say the same things about Invent4 Entertainment in five hundred years that we say about the great philosophical and artistic masters from centuries ago... Invent4 Entertainment is a modern day Socrates, or... Da Vinci... mixing both striking visual beauty with classical, daring, unheard-of intellect...

Look, he combines these things to make profoundly simple expressions...

And the Lung Rat...

I'm just... amazed... really, that after 4 years of playing, and analyzing the same game, I'm able to find new dimensions. It's a testament to the work...

For six years, I delved into tobacco research, because... can a rat smoke? This is a metaphysical question... Yes, can any rat smoke? Do we know? Can just the Lung Rat smoke?

The research says no. 

This game is their masterpiece... The Bad Rats are their masterpiece... and is their masterpiece and a marvel...

...and every day, I look in the mirror, and I hold this video game up to the mirror, and I look into the mirror, and at this little game.

Be humble.

Be thankful.

It is a reminder, be respectful.",65,english

Die Eintönigkeit und der immer gleiche Alltag eines depressiven Büroarbeiters stehen im Mittelpunkt der Geschichte. 
Dementsprechend wiederholen sich einige Dinge, die man in den 2,5-4 Stunden (je nachdem, wie süchtig man nach dem optionalen integrierten Clicker-Spiel wird) tun muss. In seinen Klamotten aufwachen, Zähne putzen, im Fahrstuhl erniedrigt werden.

Darum geht es aber nicht. Vielmehr entdeckt die Hauptfigur nach und nach die absolute Sinnlosigkeit ihrer derzeitigen Situation: etwas Seelenloses zu tun, was man hasst, um dann doch nicht die Rechnungen bezahlen zu können, die man noch mehr hasst. (An dieser Stelle gehen die Gamer-Kiddies vermutlich flöten.)
Die Entdeckung von Kleinigkeiten wie Freude und Ablenkung findet allerdings etwas zu klischeehaft statt (Sonne, Farbe, Jazz-Musik). Auch hätten die Entwickler etwas mehr Aha-/Oho-Effekte in die wiederholten Elemente einbringen können.

I love how in the middle of the fight the situation you find yourself in changes and you gotta adapt your tactics real quick. Like the other day there was that knife guy that you cannot attack just like that. Wait, no, that was today actually. So anyways, in order to beat him you need to first do the cape thing and then attack. But suddenly the chance arrised to knock him out completely, which you shouldn't do when there are others nearby, since you can't defend yourself during that. But there was no one nearby and that took me by surprise, but since I'm a pro gamer I quickly reacted, rushed over to him and knocked him out. Well, it wasn't really me, it was Batman. But the point is, that all of what I just described was an absolutely seamless concatenation of moves already stunning just by themselves. 
So the game is quite an experience. The action is rousing. Like your mind is completely wrapped up around it. Maybe it's because the game allows you to do whatever you have in mind, especially when brawling. It's super fun.

Als Teil einer Dynastie ist es die Aufgabe eine Stadt (und ein Land) zur Blüte zu führen, neue Technologien zu erforschen und möglichst lange an der Macht zu bleiben.

Bester Moment:
2006: ich klammere mich an die Macht, mit allen Mitteln. Ich drohe, ich flehe, ich lasse im Müll des Stadtrats wühlen. Mal spiele ich Information der Presse zu, mal erkläre ich dem Kollegen, dass er diskreter vorgehen muss, wenn er gerne ins Bordell geht. Seine Dankbarkeit ist mir bei der nächsten Wahl gewiss. Obwohl ich nie so werden wollte wie meine Vorväter, die diese Stadt mit eiserner Faust regiert haben, wird mir klar, dass es mir schon lange nicht mehr um das Wohl der Stadt und der Menschen hier geht. Es geht nur darum, die nächste Wahl zu gewinnen. Müsste ich dafür jemanden töten – ich würde es tun. Francis Underwood aus House of Cards wäre stolz auf mich.

Der Stadtrat entscheidet dafür, aber niemand will mehr hier leben. Zu teuer, nicht gut genug. Zu unsicher die Straßen, aber eine Polizei darf ich nicht bauen. Zu ungesund, aber ein Krankenhaus darf ich nicht bauen. Zu langweilig, aber ein Theater darf ich nicht bauen. Ich habe Pläne für einen Bahnhof vorliegen und die eines Hafens, aber der Stadtrat sperrt sich. Ich könnte all mein politisches Kapital aufwenden; aber wofür? Damit ich wieder in die Schuldenfalle tappe? Kein Interesse. Stattdessen, schaue ich auf das Modell einer Stadt, die für mich, keinen visuellen Reiz besitzt. Null Wuselfaktor, keine Brillanz. Zum gefühlten zehnten Mal wird im Stadtrat einen Beschluss zur Legalisierung der Homosexualität besprochen, zum gefühlten zehnten Mal wird er mit 95% Mehrheit abgelehnt. Die Zeitung berichtet. Ich würde gerne etwas zum besseren ändern, aber das Spiel gibt mir keine Hilfestellung wie ich das könnte.

0,steam_reviews/356400_Thumper.json,3736,1,"[h1]This is an excerpt from my full review for the online publication Hey Poor Player[/h1]

Thumper is a rhythm game. That’s all you really need to know, but it’s not all I’m going to tell you. The game would never allow me to get away with such a modest descriptor. It’s more appropriate to speak in intangibles. Thumper is anxiety. It is restlessness, wretchedness, abjection, pain, failure—and ultimately, hope and triumph. It’s a reflection of everything about yourself that you hope to never face, laid bare in the dark light of Hell. It’s what Franz Kafka might dream up if he met Trent Reznor and they invented their own programming language.  

It’s a damn fine video game, and I urge you to use this critique as a jumping-off point to do your own investigation (i.e. buy the hell out of it).

Thumper represents the next logical evolution in what rhythm games can (and should) be. Where Dance Dance Revolution celebrates the ecstasy of motion and flow, Thumper commands you to listen to the shrieking, clanging anxiousness inside each of our minds—noises that we’re unable to quell when the evening is upon us and we long for some peace and quiet. It takes a single mechanic and spins it into a tapestry of visceral destruction. It is punishingly hard, and it will make you wish you had never fallen under its spell. In my case, it made me wish I could create something even half as important.",1171,english
0,steam_reviews/356450_CreatureRomancesKokonoeKokoro.json,450,2,"Nie dajcie się nabrać, cała gra trwa może do dwóch godzin - przy założeniu, że powoli czytamy. Większość czasu zajęło mi wyrabianie kart do odznaki. I tak, te dwie godziny pozwalają spokojnie uzyskać wszystkie osiągnięcia... To może omówię ten tytuł, choć za wiele do omawiania nie ma...
Jest to nowela wizualna z wątkiem romantycznym. Bohaterem jest chłopaczek kończący właśnie szkołę średnią. Ot, przeciętniak w temacie ocen czy po prawdzie mówiąc - dowolnym innym. Ma przyjaciółkę z dzieciństwa, która jest połączeniem ludzkiej dziewczyny z konikiem polnym. Rzut oka na grafiki w sklepie pozwoli się zorientować w czym rzecz. Byłoby to może dziwne, gdyby nie fakt, że całość społecznego środowiska Ichinose składa się tego czy innego rodzaju groteskowych istot. Sam bohater nie daje nam odczuć, że jest to coś osobliwego. On sam wygląda jak najbardziej na przedstawiciela  [i]homo sapiens sapiens[/i], co też nie wzbudza żadnej kontrowersji. Możemy pójść dwoma tropami. Pierwszy zakłada, że protagonista jest istotą ludzką w świecie zaludnionym przez [i]yokai [/i] czy inne [i]obakemono [/i]. Nie jest wyjaśnione dlaczego posiada ludzką formę, choć jego rodzona siostra jest już połączeniem dziewczynki i nietoperza. Znakiem tego - urodził się w tym dziwnym świecie i jest już przyzwyczajony do tego co widzi. Drugi trop to uznanie, że chłopak ma zaburzenie psychiczne albo bardzo specyficzną odmianę zaburzenia wzroku (choćby zespół Charles'a Bonnet'a). Jedno z zakończeń sugeruje jednak raczej tą pierwszą możliwość.
Historia jest sztampowa: przyjaźń z dziecięcych lat, która może przerodzić się w miłość. Z rytmu wybijają nas ewentualnie sytuacje napotykania nowych postaci (i próby zrozumienia czym one właściwie są!). Zdarzają się też wydarzenia, które główny bohater przyjmuje z iście skrajnie stoickim spokojem, choć moim zdaniem przypadkowa demolka jednego pomieszczenia jego mieszkania powinna spotkać się z bardziej radykalnym odbiorem. Autorzy prawdopodobnie chcieli wprowadzić tutaj wątek humorystyczny, ale uzyskali tylko dystans do całej opowieści u odbiorcy. Oryginalność konceptualna produkcji jest jej klęską. O ile wygląd postaci można interpretować jako metaforę o pięknych wnętrzach skrywanych przez odrażającą powierzchowność, to wspomniany epizod niszczy tą właśnie linię interpretacyjną i pozbawia tytuł głębi czyniąc go swego rodzaju wygłupem. Powiem więcej: gdyby nie obsada złożona z dziwnych istot, to fabuła byłaby równie innowacyjna jak większość wypracowań z języka polskiego na temat ""Dlaczego Słowacki wielkim wieszczem (a może tu pasowałoby: ""świerszczem""?) był"". A żeby chociaż podróż przez meandry dialogów i wyborów była ciekawa... A gdzie tam! Jedno z trzech możliwych zakończeń jest zależne wyłącznie od jedynego dialogu z opcją wyboru w grze, a ten przytrafia się niemal na sam jej koniec. Zawiera skrajnie różne opcje naszego stosunku do Kokoro i w świetle niezmienności wydarzeń od początku gry wydają się wspomniane ekstrema dodane na siłę z pomocą młotka.
Graficznie gra prezentuje się średnio czyli kiepsko, biorąc pod uwagę, że ten gatunek gier właśnie grafiką stoi (i wieloma sposobami poprowadzenia historii, ale z tym już się rozprawiłem wyżej). W tagach zawarte jest że zawiera elementy seksualne, ale przyznamy sobie szczerze, że potrzeba nie lada estety, coby znalazł w tym podnietę dla zmysłów. Przypomnę, że kreska nie urywa głowy. Gdy więc chuć Cię opanowała i chcesz pograć w coś, gdzie znajdziesz dla niej ujście, to tę produkcję możesz spokojnie ominąć, bo naprawdę sceny erotyczne są słabe (nawet w ludzkich kategoriach oceniania).
Mamy w pełni udźwiękowione dialogi postaci po japońsku, co jest w sumie plusem, bo nadaje nowelom wizualnym odpowiedniego klimatu. Muzyka w tle... jest. Bez szału, bez zawadzania. Więcej o tym aspekcie powiedzieć się bez wodolejstwa zwyczajnie nie da.
Tytuł bez którego można się spokojnie obyć. Kwotę można przeznaczyć na coś bardziej ambitnego albo chociaż ciekawszego i wystarczającego na coś więcej niż dwie godziny straconego czasu. Forma bardzo wysublimowana, ale treść miałka.

ZALETY:
- Banalne osiągnięcia
- Intrygujący koncept

WADY:
- ... słaba jego realizacja
- Niespójność klimatu: to poważna historia czy zwykła groteska?
- Brak nawet słowa wyjaśnienia dlaczego rzeczy jawią nam się tak, a nie inaczej
- Zakończenia zależne od jednego dialogu

Hopped on the side of a wall for five minutes a couple levels back. Saw God, he was an ugly fucking wizard with a greasy looking face. A deep existential horror creeps over me every time I hear a skeleton spawn. Only joy I get is from hitting my friends with stray boxes every now and then. The words ""We do a little trolling echoes through my ears"" every time I do, and I want to vomit. I can feel it in my mouth. The bile, the regurgitated soup and mayo. I can see the end of the level constantly, but I'm constantly falling short. My flimsy fat little knight body tumbles lifeless down a corridor of wooden platforms that swing up and down. Need to buy eye drops. The characters are each defined by their individual strengths and weaknesses, each a functioning cog in some great machinery serving something beyond them (Think that's from a Fleet Foxes song). They work better together, the wizard makes boxes, the knight screams, the thief exists to make whichever player is playing her feel badass and cool.  Entered the tower, saw a shifty thing, peed a little. It's fine. I'll just sit here for a while, just think over how long I've known this world. Every level is one core color, yellow, blue, red, purple, green. Just kidding, there is no yellow level, I tricked you, dumb dumb. I was waking my way through a forest village and I think I saw a star in the sky. Are there stars in the Trine world? Do magically spawned skeleton warriors lay on their rooftops and dream of the great vast beyond. Playing this game alone would be bad, I imagine. Isolating and maddening. An undending horror. Thank god for my friend who I play with. Please ban him. You know which person I refer to my dear Steam devs, you know that I know. The wizard is a loser, but he's also not. He's arguably the most essential character, but he also is a weak fool who neither knows how to fight nor love. What does that say of wizardry as an art? Nothing, I'd argue, since wizardry isn't real. I haven't been playing Trine for 10 whole minutes and I don't know what to do with myself. The skin is peeling from my face. The knight is yelling. The music is booming. The thief is swinging off a upside down plank and shooting a skeleton midair like she's in a Fast and the Furious movie. 2 Trine 2 Thief? No. No, that's not good enough. I conjure a box and it fades into a sea of lava. The whole thing is Kafka-esque, I say, a 15 year old white boy who hasn't read a word of Kafka. I haven't seen the sunset in over a year. I am playing Trine and considering the proper way to write Batman. Is there a singularly proper way to write Batman? In my opinion, yes. Ronan is a piece of shit. His profile pic is an anime catgirl. He yells at me to stop chewing my gum so loudly. I lean in close to my mic and loudly smack my lips together. I will knock him into acid using a big stone brick soon. It will be funny for a little bit. We repeatedly scream ""We do a little trolling"" together as we struggle not to fall to our deaths. This is the most important thing we've ever done. This is the worst night of our lives.

And while it technically sort of has VR support built-in, it's not native really and requires Steam VR 'reprocessing' (I think that's what it's called) to be on, which is processing intensive and looks like garbage compared to true native, since it has to re-render every original frame again for each eye (""a copy of a copy"").  Last time I checked, X-Plane 11 was like this, too, as compared to, say, DCS that does true native, but I'll still recommend anything from Austin for a variety of other reasons.  People kept blabbering on about how great the ED VR was, but it's barely playable with that much degradation.  

As for why ED is boring, every planet and station is basically the same.  Every pirate kill mission or salvage is the same, other than the level of ship/gear you need to complete it for a given payoff.  The galaxy is vast, but nothing really is happening in it or changes and everywhere is identical.  The method Frontier used to create all these star systems creates a kind of homogeneous, rote blah.  Combine that with star systems that are inexplicably tied to a new DLC even though you've just been given missions in those systems.  So you spend an hour getting there and then all the planets are blank.  Search online and, oops, that's an expansion DLC system.  Great.  

Finally to make matters worst of all is this bizarre and ill-explained penalty system that will either send authorities after you or just spontaneously explode your ship and send you to jail far away from where you were.  Not only does that waste time transporting you away or drain credits you've built up, but now you have to find out where you're supposed to go to pay your fees.  And wait, there will be more fees with someone else soon.  It's like the space version of the movie Brazil, only not surreal, not dynamic, and there's no Robert De Niro coming to save you.  

Finally I had to admit I wasn't having fun playing this Kafkaesque version of space hell even though it was so extensive and the ship mechanics were so simmy in a fixed-wing kind of way.  It's a lot of bang for your buck, but all the bang felt like grind.  I should note I played far more than recorded by Steam, because once again Steam was malfunctioning and interfering with my system, so Frontier had to help me bypass the overlords to play ED without bugs.  Decent support from Frontier, but they seriously need get with the program on VR and also drastically improve the gameplay experience for me to reinstall this.

Désolé mais, la physique est très en-deçà de ce à quoi on pourrait s'attendre. Elle correspond à un modèle atmosphérique, votre vaisseau ralentit par exemple lorsque vous sortez le train d'atterrissage, et la maniabilité du véhicule est variable.

Au-delà de ça, le jeu est extrêmement répétitif, la galaxie est grande, oui mais les planètes se ressemblent et on ne peut les visiter. Il n'y a aucune sorte de moyen de sortir de votre vaisseau. Le gameplay se résume à : prendre mission > faire mission > parfois un combat > rebelotte.

Le design des vaisseaux ? Pas mon truc non plus, surtout le premier, absolument affreux, mais c'est une question de goût comme on dit. N'empêche, je ne suis pas le seul à trouver que ces vaisseaux n'ont aucun charme et surtout leur mécanique utilise énormément de raccourcis scénaristiques, on ne sait pas comment ils fonctionnent.

L'histoire ? Quelle histoire ? Elle n'a soit aucun intérêt, soit il n'y en a quasiment pas. Vous pouvez profiter du jeu de la même façon que vous connaissiez ou non l'histoire d'Elite Dangerous.

It's the end of my first week at this place. I - heh - I was excited for the quiet, for the isolation. I've learned this past week that I would kill, FUCKING KILL for the din of a busy restaurant, for a socially inept slacktivist with a petition to invade my personal space, even for a shouting match with my brother.


It's funny when you think about it.


What I would give to see another... lost my train of thought. It's hard to stay coherent when you're bleeding to death. 


Is a nightmare still a nightmare if you can't wake up?


You know what's the worst thing about this? 


They will NEVER find me. Three Laws my ass.


Uncanny Valley isn't that place where children eat vegetables smothered in ranch dressing and it isn't exclusive to sex sequences in David Cage games. The uncanny valley is a theory that suggests robots and CGI too lifelike (but still ""off"" or unrealistic in that uniquely robot/CGI way) is SUPER, SUPER CREEPS.

I subscribe to this theory, personally.

Uncanny Valley is a story as old as time: Tom, our hero, managed to score a security job at a facility tucked away in the mountains where The Shining was filmed. Over the course of the two hour game you'll explore the facility, shoot the shit with your coworker Buck, and unearth horrible secrets you should probably not have unearthed. It's classic survival horror down to a T, and Uncanny Valley nails the mechanics and atmosphere admirably.

Uncanny Valley revolves around the night guard job. Tom's shift lasts seven fleeting minutes, which at first seems a little punishing. Muster enough motivation, however, and you can cover a lot of ground during your rounds, checking emails and exploring offices, labs, and warehouses. During Tom's rounds he'll pick up video recordings, audio recordings, and plot progression tools. With each passing night scripted events will occur which, depending on the player's actions, will alter the events resulting in a variety of endings and fail states. I haven't seen a game with such subtle variety since Silent Hill 2 (the thematic opposite of later series entry Silent Hill 5: Back 2 tha Hood).

But is it scary?

If you watch my video you may determine that no, it is not. Which is what I thought initially! And I'm pretty easy to frighten. But you'd be wrong to think such naive thoughts. While it isn't overtly terrifying, it is... creepy. Unsettling. Sinister. It plays a lot like a Japanese horror game where you can't quite shake the feeling that you're being watched by something bigger and badder than you that's just biding its time, watching you squirm while it finishes its taxes. And I'll be honest with you: I'm a pretty jaded guy. But there were some moments in this game where I was revolted, and that's not a sensation I can say many games have made me experience.

But it isn't all starshine and puppy farts, unfortunately. Besides some weirdly written dialogue, wonky voice acting, and typos here and there there are some bugs. Manipulable objects can sometimes be pushed out of frame, and Tom will occasionally load into an area and plop down as if he were hovering. Worse still I encountered a bug where Tom's shift would end before it began which led to some Kafkaesque shenanigans where I couldn't make him sleep and he just passed out where he stood after some time (at one point I couldn't even get Buck to leave the office). I'm not sure how frequent this is, and if some of the ""bugs"" I encountered were just the game being spOoOoky. If you have any trepidation just wait to see what bugs are encountered at launch and hopefully the devs will patch any serious offenders.

All that aside I think Uncanny Valley is an atmospheric, enthralling horror game. Classic survival horror enthusiasts will have fun pursuing the different endings, solving puzzles, and getting out of sticky situations.

...

Anyway, your shift starts soon... oh, you don't look so good. Close your eyes for a bit, I'll keep watch.

Promise.

He also happens to have gunboots, and people dotted along the way that are willing to extend his mortal life and give him more ammunition by trading in the crystalline souls of dead creatures. For what end, it isn’t uncovered.

Each shot is able to counter-act about 90% of the effect of gravity impacted on the boy, so the level of trauma not only on the shot creature, but also on the legs and hips of the boy, is absolutely tremendous. Landing on a creature or having a creature touch your boots instantly vaporises them, sometimes in a reaction so violent that it destroys the nearby brick and mortar of the well.

Quindi tocca a voi comandare la ragazzina nel tentativo di fuggire dall'istituto e ritornare di nuovo a casa.

Il gioco è piuttosto duraturo direi quasi 10 ore senza soluzione, ma la storia prende una piega strana, convertendosi da prima al fantasy e poi in roba psichedelica alla frank kafka. Il gioco merita di essere giocato se vi piace l'horror e anche le avventure grafiche ma la pecca più grande di tutto il titolo è la non traduzione in italiano. Che toglie un bel pò di atmosfera.

0,steam_reviews/366910_TheLongJourneyHome.json,1801,1,"I bought this in a bundle after Daedalic streamed on Steam from Hamburg and UK developers, mostly for this game, but the other games proved to be exceptional as well.  I saw them demo Crazy Machines 3, Holy Potatoes, Franz Kafka (sp?), The Long Journey Home, and Anna.  The team did a great job, many of them curious about the games as they had not played the full versions before for some.

This game draws heavily on one of my favorite older games called Starflight on PC (later then on Sega Genesis).

You pull together a crew of your choice.  You choose your style of main ship and shuttlecraft/landers.

You test the first FTL jump that goes wrong and flings you far away.  At least it is not like in X where you have no clue as to where you are.  There is always the goal of to make it home in sight and how to get there, though the many choices of how to achieve this are yours.

I've been through a few runs through this game already, though am still in the learning stages, and it does require some skill, especially in piloting the landing craft.  My first run, I couldn't find many gasses to harvest so my life support went down and all suffocated to death quite quickly.  My second run, my lander got destroyed quickly though we were able to get replacements easily enough, the injuries to the lander crew took its toll.  I've used the same generation key each time, but my experience was vastly different from run to run.  

The developers playing this game made it look very easy, and they had fun with it, acting out the well written scripts.  The amount of writing in this game is immense.

I plan on playing this one for a long time to come.  Great job!

0,steam_reviews/367520_HollowKnight.json,290636,2,"Before we start, I want to just state: Hollow Knight is a masterpiece in it's own genre.

[h1]SETTING[/h1]
You don't know who you are, and you don't know why are you here. You take the first steps in this eerie, dark world, where everything seems cold and... somehow you feel you arrived home. You learn how to jump, and immediately, you learn that spikes are dangerous. After a couple of doors, you finally arrive and meet the first creature in the small village, which is still intact in this world. The elder looking bug gives you an advice. Don't go down the well, as only more horror and shadows await you there. You sit down to a nearby bench and you know you will remember this moment, whatever happens. You approach the mentioned well, and jump right in without looking back at the older looking bug creature. Your story in Hallownest just started.

[h1]STORY[/h1]
The story of Hollow Knight is very subtle, the narrative is entirely based on how much you explore. On the journey, you will encounter many characters, some are fierce, some are funny, some are wise and some gives you a relaxed feeling about what is going on. The more places you go, the more story unveils in front of you, and slowly but steadily you understand why are you here, and who are you. When you're at the point of finishing the game... you go online and watch a Mossbag lore video, and understand what the hell did you just experienced in the last 40-50 hours of gameplay. Magnificent.

[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
Hollow Knight has a cartoony, yet very strange and dark artstyle. Somehow each character is scary, but adorable at the same time, and by the time you finish the game, you get attached to these Kafka-like creatures, when you see the last of NPCs, your first thought will be [i]""WOW, he looks AWESOME!""[/i] instead of [i]""Well, this looks weird""[/i]. I think the artstyle of the game is beautifully helps the narrative, and goes very well with how you experience the game. I couldn't imagine this game being an RTX ON cell shaded, 3D motion captured monster, and this wouldn't work also with the genre's very popular pixel art as well. It is perfect.

[h1]MUSIC[/h1]
Christopher Larkin is a freaking musical GENIUS. After I finished the game, I listed to it's soundtrack for weeks. It is uplifting, sad, energizing, depressing, this music not only triggers certain emotions in you, the music [b]itself[/b] have it's own emotions, and you are basically feel those, as a sign of sympathy. Even if you decide not to give a chance to Hollow Knight after this review, at least go and listen to some of it's music, and think again of buying. It is definitely a selling point.

[h1]CHARACTERS[/h1]
In this game, believe it or not, every character has a story. Even some of the enemies which you slain have some of their backstories, they are more living creatures in a dark underworld, than some random NPCs for your to interact with. What would you say if I told you, you will learn to love small Metamorphosis styled creatures in 40-50 hours of gameplay from now? Hornet, Elderbug, the Dung Defender, all of them are lovable and interesting characters, with their own way of communication and style of talking. Each of them are distinct, yet somehow similarly adorable... bug people? [i]Sigh...Bappanada.[/i]

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania, and as that, it is a masterfully designed game. The game teaches you everything you need to know without even one message box popping up, and breaking your immersion. In the beginning, it helps you a little bit with some advice, but everything else you need to figure out on your own. The battle system (if you can call it that) is very self explanatory, and it is really up to the players what style of combat they prefer.  As a Metroidvania, platforming is an element of the game, but it is not the most significant part of the game. There is one dreadful level where your platforming skills will be tested, and there is an extra level which will take that testing to the next level, however, like with everything else in the game, it is a reachable, with trial and error. In this game you will die. And you will die a lot, until you learn the jumps and the enemy movement, and when you get to the point to try out the DLCs, you will be able to do the previous fights and platforming levels with ease. There are some very hard boss fights which took me several hours to finish, but retrospectively, I say every minute... well hour worth it. 

[h1]ACHIEVEMENTS and REWARD[/h1]
If you are a completionist, like some of my friends are - and is some cases, to a certain level, I am - you will enjoy the content which this game offer. There are plenty of achievements, and some of them are at a skill requirement which you will need hours and hours to master. However, as a very average gamer that I am, even I could do the 112% Achievement, which is basically means that you did everything the game could offer, of course, there are some achievements which you can unlock after beating the game to a full extent. The reward for mastering the game is there, and it is beautiful - but I won't spoil it for you. :)

[h1]VERDICT[/h1]
[b]Hollow Knight[/b], as I said, is a masterpiece in it's own genre. It is clever, interesting, chilling, amusing and very, very hard game. You will sink tens and tens of hours playing, and will not even notice that you are over 60 hours of gameplay. I can recommend this game. Aside for a few game design flaws -- [i]Why do you have to travel MINUTES just to go back to a boss you couldn't beat?[/i], I would say it a near perfect game. I 100% recommend it.
All in all, I would rate this game 9/10.

（当然如果你是想购买而不是白嫖的话，还是建议等一个打折，日常到个位数）

[h1]先说说我最喜欢的部分——令人莞尔的冷幽默[/h1]
这个游戏做得最令人满意的地方就在于丰满而有个性的人物（两位主角）塑造，比如主角Kathy（以下简称K）是一个叛逆张扬的朋克女孩，在玩家与所有可交互对象点击互动时，可以听到她调皮又幽默的吐槽，而她和几个NPC的对话也常常是带有讽刺意味的冷幽默，玩的时候经常会忍不住会心一笑；而女主的好朋友兼室友Eileen（以下简称E），在Day1探索寝室的时候就能从她整齐的床铺、日程安排表、粉色泰迪熊和床头的手工十字架轻易构造出一个乖巧优等生和虔诚基督徒的形象，而开头短短一分钟的对白又展现出她积极主动、好奇心强烈、行动力十足的性格。
其他配角的形象比较片面，但每位角色的台词和配音（对话全语音）都是精心设计的，举几个让我印象深刻的例子：
[list]
[*]在警察局会遇到一个因为偷窃被抓的废柴大叔G，在被放出来之后去诊所门口遇到他
K：又见面了，无家可归先生
G：嘿小丫头（“Missy”）！你说什么呢，我可是混好莱坞的
K：好吧，游手好闲先生，给我讲讲好莱坞生活？
（这游戏交互的设计是你可以拿任何道具展示给某个对象看，如果你选择向他展示钥匙，对话会变成）
K：你猜这把钥匙能打开什么地方的门？
G：是你的心吗，小姐？（“Your heart，Mademoiselle？”）
[spoiler]突如其来的土味撩妹[/spoiler]和这个Mademoiselle的称呼就很灵性，完美体现了演员的自我修养（笑
[*]在向飞行员基地询问资料时对方会拒绝，这时候K会“借用”警察局的电话
基地：好吧，通话路线确实是从警局播出的，可我觉得你不像警察啊？
K：（假装狂怒）你说什么？你凭什么说我不像警察？就因为我是个女人吗？！你们这些——
基地：呃…不……我不是…这个意…
K：你知道我每天过得是什么日子吗？！哈！
K：接听电话、端茶倒水、永远没有出警机会！
基地：我——
K：当然不像警察了！在性别歧视者看来我做什么都是错的！
基地：冷静！女士，请冷静一下——好吧，你想查询什么资料？
Kathy也蛮有演员修养的噢2333
[*]后期遇到一个穿红西服的光头，说话酷爱使用指代词，喜欢故弄玄虚让人猜测
K：把你的隐喻指数调低一个档行吗，卡夫卡先生？我在中学课本里就已经受够了。
这个Mr. Kafka用得太贴切了，真实笑出声
[*]K和E在讨论一条线索的时候
K：E,关于Cocky这个昵称你有什么思路吗？
E：呃，这个词会让我想到……boy part嘿嘿嘿你懂的……
K（目瞪口呆）：what？！你…你还号称是个基督徒吗？（大笑）
稍微解释一下，cock是翘，本身也有penis的意思，cocky可以理解为“翘尾巴”，所以Eileen顺势开了个黄♂腔，而K之所以提到基督徒，是因为按照基督教义，非婚性行为（哪怕是意淫）也是有罪的。所以这里的笑点算是个连击，她说[spoiler]╰∪╯[/spoiler]的时候我没笑，但是她说教徒的时候，哈哈哈哈哈
顺便说一句，[spoiler]有个观念误区是通常认为比起东方人，西方人较为性开放，但其实不全是这样，在基督徒里也有一群宣扬处男处女的，像你看到一个福音派基督徒无名指戴着戒指的话，不一定是婚戒，也可能是守贞戒指。[/spoiler]
[/list]

[h1]简单介绍一下解谜和剧情[/h1]
我不想剧透这个故事，但我又很难在不剧透的情况下展示它的奇妙构思，凶杀、玄幻、宗教、超自然、精神疾病……对，这个故事也有一点“大卫·林奇”：你得猜测角色的暗喻、分辨幻象和现实，然后用自己的思路把未写尽的结局补完，再对自己无法确定的部分叹一声“啊，意犹未尽”。不过它毕竟没有《双峰》那么玄（也没有那么妙），即使不去细想它背后的脉络，依然是个能吸引人看到最后的故事（不过可能会对结局有点失望）。
故事从K去参加祖父的葬礼开始，祖母向她透露了十几年前发生在祖父身上的诡异事故，由此她踏上了一条追寻真相之路，在途中又牵涉到更早的一起少女溺亡案和父亲好友的精神疾病，这些“发生在过去的案件”巧妙地营造了一种危险迫在眉睫的氛围，玩家能感到有一股仍在视线之外的威胁正随着你的调查不可避免地缓缓逼近；
整个剧情共分为5天，作者的叙事节奏掌握得较为熟练，每一天解开几条真相，再向玩家抛出一点线索，而玩家主要通过找不同NPC询问关键词和使用道具来推进故事的进程，调查部分有一定逻辑，但奇葩的部分也不少，比如诓演员大叔假装癫痫发作，自己从背后偷袭他以骗走前台，自己趁机去电脑里查资料，还有什么越狱、撬锁、偷密码、伪造录音、放火烧山（总之这个主角已经不能用离经叛道来形容了）这些理论上可行，但是实际操作完全属于开挂的行为都比较明显，而且因为关键道具有限，基本上不需要提示也能想到，解谜里唯一有一点点难度的是后期的字谜部分，以诗歌的形式藏线索可能对非母语玩家不太友好，不过我觉得也不能说难，因为关键词还是比较显眼的，而且人家连密码的位数都告诉你了，甚至得出密码的过程也是一层一层设计好的，非常贴心了。

[h1]无轨电车[strike]瞎捷豹开[/strike]时间[/h1]
终于到了我爱的无责任分析部分😎
前面说过这个故事的结局看似有些虎头蛇尾，有一些谜题作者并未全部清晰地展示给玩家，而浓郁的超自然元素使得本就不甚明朗的真相变得更为神秘。在这个方面我和[url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/370910/] 这位大佬[/url]的意见有点类似，就是它实际上已经交代了，只是太隐晦，如果没有理清因果关系或者没有往这个方面猜，可能就察觉不到作者的暗示。

[b]剧透预警，请确认你已通关或决定不玩这个游戏后再往下读[/b]
[b]胡说八道预警，以下内容都是笔者的个人揣测，有过度解读和完全猜错的可能，可以选择性跳过[/b]

“这个方面“指的是什么？
——荣格提出的人格分析心理学说
具体到本作的思路就是：被自我（the ego）拒之门外的心里材料会进入个人无意识，影响到一个人的自性（the self），继而自主、自发地影响甚至隐射到现实中，“任何被自性拒绝的东西（心理事实），都会以事件（物理事实）的形式显现。“，而对自性的完善正是（宗教说法）灵魂的自我救赎。

在本作里非常明显的第一个例子就是K在墓地见到的一个小男孩，说是和母亲一起来的，K问他你妈妈在哪，他说就在这里，而四周都没有别人的踪迹，通过后来的剧情我们了解到这是她多年前打胎掉的孩子的“灵魂“，但我个人认为与其说是灵魂，不如说是她自身痛苦、压抑的一部分”阴影（the shadow）人格“投影到集体无意识后产生的幻觉（考虑到她母亲也有严重的精神疾病）。毕竟孩子还没出生就死了，没听说过灵魂还会发育长大的，而她自己可能会有无意识的”如果生下来到现在七八岁“这种想法，因此才会看见一个七八岁小男孩的幻象

第二个不太明显的例子就是那个穿深红西服的光头the Crimson One，他作为最终反派，一直在向K和神父阐述他侍奉的“旧神“，但仔细回想了一下：
①这个故事里的所有正常人都否认了见过听过这个深红之人的存在
②K见到他的情景要么是在梦里，要么是在开着一种红色致幻花的湖边；在牢房电视听到他声音的时候也是独自一人，尤其是当K第一次梦见他的时候，场景中的深红之人有两个，一个黑白的倒吊着在和彩色的那个争吵
③在这个故事里提到深红之人的人不少，但巧的是他们都有一些精神上的问题，而且从没有两个人同时看见他，唯一作为罪犯被抓捕的小神父并不能见到和找到深红之人。
所以我大胆猜测一下，这个深红之人有没有可能是她个人无意识和集体无意识的消极化形（内心的恶魔），所以带着她自身对宗教明显的偏见和抵触。同理老神父所见到的深红之人和她见到的或许并不是同一个，老神父面对的也是他自己内心的偏执或者别的什么，毕竟“宗教陈述是以无意识为基础的心理表达”。

感谢@Jacques 的指正和补充，crimson应该指代“罪”的概念：“耶和華說：「你們來，我們彼此辯論。你們的罪雖像朱紅，必變成雪白；雖紅如丹顏，必白如羊毛。”（以赛亚书1：18）

最后最重要的例子就是Day5全天发生的事。
先分析一下K的成长过程中可能会成为“阴影“的经历：
幼年时母亲精神错乱、父亲抛下二人离家出走、她与母亲共同生活但忍无可忍后将母亲送到疗养院、原生家庭经历导致她十分畏惧家庭生活因而儿子胎死腹中、祖父出事后未能陪伴他且一直到他死K才了解到这一切（包括曾经想把她从母亲身边接过来）感到十分愧疚；
现在来看Day5事件的顺序：
首先在一个开满致幻花的地方，嗅了一口之后深红之人出现，把K引导了一个深渊的底下（居然是坐自动扶梯下去的=。=）
地下一楼场景是由祖父家魔改的，二楼是父亲常去的俱乐部魔改，三楼是湖边小屋魔改，K在二楼的小房间里看到了被吊着的母亲？，被发狂地攻击后不得已捅死了她，留下“我原谅你“后尸体消失
出门后捡到父亲的明信片“从未后悔过遗弃你、从未爱过你“，被另一个自己带着一个父亲？追杀，成功制服后明信片上的字变成“离开你是我犯过的最大的错误，请原谅我”
打开三楼笼子里的棺材后儿子出现，质问K是否后悔，K表示已经过去，必须继续往前走
此时当年溺水少女出现，让K前往魔改的祖父客厅 ，在门前遇到另一个自己，朝她怒吼“你为什么这么恨我们？我们对你做了什么？！（注意这里用的us和we）”K回答：我不再畏惧你了，我感受到了你的真实面孔……滚开吧
随后在客厅见到祖父，诉说了对他的想念和歉意，祖父鼓励K：你不需要我了孩子，你比你想象中的更坚强，我为你感到自豪
K回到地面，烧毁了所有致幻花海，结束了一切。

可以很明显的看到，这些[strike]鸡汤[/strike]事件和她成长经历中的心理创伤是一一对应的，连顺序都没有改变，即使故事里仍然有一部分不能用“幻想”和潜意识来解释的问题，还是多少涉及了一些超自然现象，但可以得出结论的是作者并非在漫无目的地使用超自然元素把说不下去的故事强行圆起来，而是早就精心构思了这样的情节；
为什么深红之人在结尾没有交代？因为他托生于Kathy，是她自性中的一部分，而经过这一系列的——我想称之为——神秘体验之后，K的自我已经认识到并接纳了这些痛苦的、压抑的、黑暗的部分人格，因而自性趋向于统一，她的心灵得到了治愈，所以问题的源头解决了，契机（致幻花）销毁了，哪里需要什么更多的解释呢。

与其说这是超自然主义作品，我更愿意相信这是一个精神分析实例。

0,steam_reviews/374030_Virginia.json,3156,2,"I...[i]think[/i] I recommend [i]Virginia[/i]? I'm...I'm not sure. There's a helluva a lot to unpack here.

On the surface, [i]Virginia[/i] is a game presented in an overtly cinematic style about a young FBI agent's first case, that of a missing child from Kingdom, Virginia. In reailty, the game's a meditation on racial and sexual politics, on the corrupting nature of power, of individual responsibility in the face of abused authority, the inescapable nature of the past, and...I [i]think[/i] a vaguely Kafkaesque narrative that draws signifcant influence from the works of the Coen brothers' films [i]Fargo[/i] and [i]The Man Who Wasn't There[/i].

I think. I'm not entirely sure. This is a surreal one.

There's a lot of debate as to whether [i]Virginia[/i] is a video game or not, and while I myself  can see both sides of the argument, I think, without spoiling anything, the absolute insanity that is the third act of this title prevents it from being anything [i]except[/i] a video game. The esoteric and visually driven plot of the game, to say nothing of its clever use of subjectivity, lead to it being a surprisingly thoughtful experience, despite the lack of any general mechanics. Make no mistake, this is not a game with a huge amount of replay value. (Save, of course, for the sort of value you might find in rereading a book or rewatching a film.) But in the same way that the [i]Uncharted[/i] series borrows from the language of cinema to present a linear narrative, [i]Virgina[/i] strips the game of all but the most essential mechanical aspects to tighten the experience to a razor sharp edge. I mean, I genuinely cannot think of another game that uses [i]montage[/i] of all things to tell its story.

[i]Virginia[/i] probably isn't everyone's cup of tea. If you play games more out of the opporunity to challenge your skills and find meaning in deep gameplay and/or systemic play are going to be let down. [i]Virginia[/i] isn't a title interested in [i]your[/i] experience as Player One. It's a prewritten, predetermined story, and it wants to share that if not necessarily allow for deviation from that path. On the other hand, if you're interested in seeing a different side to video games, one which focuses on the subjectivity of experience and immersion via tone, this title might just be for you. I personally bought this during a Humble Bundle sale and was blown away. If you're still on the fence, maybe wait 'til a sale.

I think.",219,english
0,steam_reviews/374030_Virginia.json,3156,2,"Heh, hard to begin. I'm a big time Lynch, Twilight Zone, Poe, Kafka and Lovecraft fan, not so much X-Files, so getting Virginia was an obvious choice. Probably high expectations ruined it in my case. I was thinking a long time to recommend this game or not and I'm aware some will dislike the review because of the red thumb. I really like deeper art than todays popular movies and games, so please don't take my review as a bull describing a flower. Anyway:

The best part for me was the music, which is obviously Twin Peaks inspired. I'm cool with the art style too, which blends nicely with the music. There are some pretty cool scenes, which are both emotional and I didn't see similar camera angles and situations in any other game, while there are plenty cliche moments too. The reason for my downvote is that this is all the game has to offer. It could be so much more. I suppose it's really not that easy to be Lynch as it seems. I'm actually fine that there ain't a single spoken word in the game, but then you need to be a badass director to evoke distinctive characters. Virginia manages to do it to some degree, but IMHO, not enough by far.  Lynch, Jarmusch, Coppola, some french directors can do it, but this simply isn't on that level and pretends to be. I don't want to be rude, but if you read still, I hope you understand my standpoint, so in a negative way, I could describe Virginia as a walking sim on rails without speech. But honestly this is so one-sided, it's not fair to the game. It makes you think ""outside of the box"", but unfortunately so hard, that it backfired for me. Maybe I'm just too stupid, but it has extreme changes in pace, which more confuse than excite. I think the writer should dance with the reader, not beat him. Not teach him to walk, but dance. Anyway, believe me, my review is more clear than the game :)

PS: save for me was non-existent. Not just save, but game settings too. It's short so you can play it in one sitting and also you can choose chapters to start from, so no big deal, but it's surely not a plus for the dev. Despite them recommending ""cinematic"" 30fps, I played it with 60. Had to set to 60 fps on every start of the game.

BTW The review almost took longer than the game :D",166,english

To be honest I gave up on the first boss the first time I tried to play but after some time I decided to try again and it was great. The mechanics of the game take some getting used to and there isn't a tutorial to guide you through.
 In short, this is the most kafkaesque game I have ever played; it is hard but rewarding and if you're struggling there is always the internet to help you through (beware of spoiler.).

[h1]Summary[/h1]
As someone who immensely enjoyed World of Goo and Little Inferno, I was really excited to try the developers' next game, Human Resource Machine. Upon starting the game, I was glad to see that it retained the unique aesthetic sense from the previous titles, but that feeling was quickly overtaken by a sense of frustration and apathy. After the first few stages the puzzles increased in difficulty in such a sharp and dramatic manner that I felt blindsided.

Each stage of the game represents a year of employment and entails solving a programming problem involving some form of alphanumeric input and using your set of basic instructions to manipulate the data to conform to a desired form of output that your in-game boss communicates to you. You must construct a basic program using such tools as commands to pick items up from the input conveyor, copying to and from designated spaces, adding, subtracting, setting jump points useful for repeating sections of code and making conditional operations based on the data you happen to be working with at the moment. The puzzles start out easy enough, and it's simply a matter of arranging the commands at your disposal. After a short while though, the puzzles become exponentially more complicated and the game expects the player to take the few simple tools it gives, and use them to perform operations that the game makes little to no effort to explain. It felt as though since the game has established that you are capable of performing subtraction, you must therefore also be capable of not only division, but taking the products of multiple division operations, sorting them, and outputting them in a particular order – all using only the most basic of mathematical tools. Is it possible to accomplish these tasks? Yes. But the game doesn't establish the link between the simple and the complex, and doesn't prepare the player for the challenges it puts to them.

I spent a period of time that I felt was sufficient with each puzzle and while the first quarter of the game was doable, after a while it became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to solve the rest of these puzzles on my own. Since I wasn't particularly enjoying the experience I decided I would follow a guide and at least see if the story held any value. Unfortunately, what story is there is merely window dressing. Whereas the previous titles World of Goo and Little Inferno had stories that shed some light on their dystopian surrealist worlds, the world of Human Resource Machine is never particularly enriched. Apparently a machine army is taking over and nobody in the game seems to notice or care. Nor is it relevant to the challenges you are facing. The Kafkaesque setting and characters led me to believe that there was probably a message in here, but by the end I found I didn't know what, if any, message was meant to be conveyed and I no longer particularly cared.

In the end, I can only recommend this game to people that enjoy this very narrow type of programming-based logic puzzle. Anyone else will likely be frustrated and bored, and unfortunately the charming graphics and music won't be enough to keep the player's interest.",180,english
0,steam_reviews/377160_Fallout4.json,308053,1,"FALLOUT 4 IS A HOUSE-FLIPPER WITH GUNS AND BETTER WRITTEN DLC THAN THE BASE GAME. 8/10

I played F4 for 150 hours a couple of years ago and got bored without ever finishing it. I'd wander the wasteland doing missions for grubby randos, and then occasionally one of them would let me build a shed or wire up a laser turret in their wife's bedroom, and I'd spend a few hours trying to snap some wooden walls together when there's a perfectly serviceable house ten feet away. This quickly got tiresome and I felt I was just going through the motions. It sat un-played in my Steam Library for a few years until I watched Many A True Nerd's video retrospective on the game and decided I'd give it another go.
Almost from the off, I had a better time with the game, thanks to my own personal gameplay loop. I started building at the Red Rocket Truck Stop (the first settlement you can unlock and build in), and began the gameplay loop that would see me sink 300 hours into a single character.
I would find a settlement, come up with a cool idea for what I wanted to build, build as much as possible until I ran out of materials, then I'd head off into the world to do quests, scavenge or trade until I could afford to build more of my settlement. On it's own, this could have gotten boring, if it weren't for just how easy to abuse the Settlement building mechanics were. Very quickly, building settlements went from being a paradoxical House Flipper rip-off where I delete perfectly usable stone walls and replace them with some sticks and tarpaulin, to one of the most engaging puzzle platformers I've ever played. The snap mechanics on building walls are dreadful and brilliant at the same time; if you can place the first wall somewhere the game thinks it ought not to be possible, the snap mechanics 9/10 superceed the invalid placements, so, once you have one wall where it shouldn't be, you can usually snap some more walls onto it. There was a sort of sadistic satisfaction in the settlement building, I felt like i was fighting with the game to make things that shouldn't have been possible; every wall I clipped through the world, every schoolbus I placed on stilts, every bedroom I crammed into the tiniest crawl-space and every second I spent watching the AI trying to path through it all, was payback for pretty lousy stories, repetitive fetch quests or errands for one of the game's factions, and the janky and uninteresting dialogue.
Like I said, I began at RRTS, totally ignored Concord, and explored the entire north-west of the map before meeting Preston Garvey. Red Rocket would be my centre of operations for the rest of the game, a place where I'd leave my favourite companions, fill chests with special weapons and collectables. In building these spaces for myself i discovered something unexpected.
Fallout 4 is often (and often rightly) criticised for its lack of roleplaying potential, the writers seem to have come up with a character and a story which is engaging and personal, but that doesn't leave much room for that character to be what the player wants, with most dialogue no matter how the player chooses to conduct themselves, leading to the same outcome. But with the settlements, the player can roleplay to their heart's content, but instead of creating a character, you're creating a community; it's worldbuilding. It feels like you are adding to the game, that the settlements you create, with their individual backstories and structures all invented by you, are a part of Fallout 4's world. Building these narratives was fun, and afforded way more freedom to roleplay and act on the world than the dialogue or story. Each new settlement felt like a new character, with its own story; Red Rocket was my home in the wastes where I lived with my dog and horded comic books - Vault 88 was an underground shanty town run by wastelanders who indentured the Vault's population, with a Checkpoint Charlie in the cave between the town and a local cult of Atom - Starlight Drive was a sprawling market bazaar - Hangman's Alley was a neonpunk crime-district - Kingsport Lighthouse was a thriving fishing village - Croup manor became a hotel run by ghouls - Castle became a sprawling city, built within the safe walls, with strata of society divided by their location within the fort. The potential for settlement building is limitless (technically, unless you change the building limit in the console, which i wholeheartedly recommend you do), and it's honestly the best thing F4 has going for it.
As i said before, dialogue is pretty janky, except for in a few scenes that were actually good, the standout sections which allowed for roleplay and some well written dialogue were the interviews with Piper and Valentine. I will also mention the Silver Shroud quests because the hammy comicbook dialogue is hilarious. It's worth mentioning also that all the dialogue in Farharbor is great, with more engaging factions too.
Combat is pretty standard, the gunplay is functional and VATS are still useful, especially with high Luck. Weapon crafting is fantastic, i have basically no criticisms of any of the crafting. The legendary weapons are also brilliant, especially if you get a good one out of the RNG, these weapons can stick with you for the entire game if you get a really good one (I, for example, got a disciples knife with the 'Powerful' effect giving it +25% damage, this weapon was so good it single-handedly encouraged me to put points into melee perks just to upgrade it in the workbench).
Overall, I recommend Fallout 4 as a post-apocalyptic hybrid of House Flipper and the Sims, a brilliant exercise in world building that more often than not will see you segregating your societies by faction or class (or maybe that's just me, I don't want to think about it), the gunplay is fun, exploration is rewarding, crafting is great, the dialogue is mediocre in the base game but good in the DLC (Especially if you play the Mechanist DLC wearing the Silver Shroud costume). Part of me wonders if this game wouldn't benefit from just being an open world survival game with crafting and base-building and no NPCs to interact with................... oh. 
TLDR: Combat is fun, crafting is good, talking is an exercise in early-years education, and settlement building is a kafkaesque dystopian nightmare of your own making but at least you get to feel like you're getting revenge on the game for all the stuff you didn't enjoy by breaking the placement engine.",28552,english
0,steam_reviews/379430_KingdomComeDeliverance.json,109370,1,"Kingdom Come: Deliverance sentait le pétard mouillé à plein nez, et malheureusement, beaucoup de mes craintes se vérifient sur le produit final, dont certains aspects sont difficilement excusables!
Mais miraculeusement, le jeu surprend si agréablement sur d’autres facettes (dont je n’attendais pourtant pas grand-chose), que son intérêt s'en retrouve finalement préservé !

Ce jeu m’a littéralement happée (ma 1ere partie a duré 7h)! Pourtant, l'absence TOTALE d'optimisation et de finitions plombe énormément l'expérience!

-Framerate généralement à 65FPS, mais chutant et coinçant souvent à 10, entraînant de longs freezes parfois successifs (plus particulièrement les zones à PNJs). Je précise que c'est FRÉQUENT, et que faire des grosses concessions d'ultra à élevé voire ""moyen"" dans certains domaines n’y change RIEN. [i](Drivers à jour, i5 +16Go +GTX 1060 : mes perfs vont bien, merci).[/i] L'image du jeu FIGE littéralement, au point qu'on se demande si ça a planté! (Et ça arrive : 4 crashs jusqu'ici).
-Popping incessant des textures qui RAMENT à se charger, alors que (même au max) elles sont pourtant loin d’être extraordinaires!
-Dès les premiers dialogues, on constate des soucis : passages muets ou non traduits, synchro labiale façon ""ventriloque""… Et ça survient dès la (longue) intro, c'est à se demander si ça a été testé!
-Problèmes de pathfinding et de collisions (impossible de monter un escalier - puis ça passe au 3e essai).
-Bien qu'intéressants et exigeants, les combats sont malheureusement un peu mous, en partie à cause d'une pénible latence dans les coups portés (peut-être due au jeu qui rame, je ne sais pas).
-Le système de sauvegarde est INFECT! Aberrant de confondre à ce point ""médiéval"" & ""archaïque""! Cette limitation n'apporte RIEN dans un RPG. De plus, c'est complètement irresponsable d'imposer ça dans un jeu aussi buggé et enclin aux crashs (car les innombrables problèmes techniques peuvent vraiment occasionner de grosses pertes de données accidentelles!) Donc si vous êtes comme moi maniaque de la save fréquente, le rythme en deviendra beaucoup plus ""lent"" & chiant : vous allez criser à perdre votre temps en allers-retours bien ""rétros"", re-devenant esclave d'un système pourtant classé ""obsolète"" depuis longtemps déjà!
-Lors des combats à multiples adversaires, le lock est à la rue.
-Les grosses batailles pleines de PNJs souffrent tout particulièrement de freezes graves qui interrompent vos timings de combos & parades en cours : ces phases pourtant épiques s'en retrouvent vraiment gâchées. (Et je ne m'étendrai pas trop sur les IA aux comportements parfois kafkaïens...)
-Même si avec l'expérience ça finit par devenir simple, passer les 1ers niveaux de crochetage & vol à la tire s'avère infernal et presque décourageant tant c'est mal expliqué!
-Le coté RPG des dialogues confronte les stats des persos de façon parfois visible si vous avez l’aptitude de ""empathie"". Sauf que la réussite semble souvent dépendre de la réponse choisie et non du score des stats comparées!
-De plus, Kingdom Come a un rapport au réalisme pointu, mais parfois bancal:
Si tirer au jugé à l'arc sans réticule s'avère jouissif & gratifiant quand on commence à bien toucher, c'est foireux que des marchands devinent ""magiquement"" qu'on leur écoule du matos volé ailleurs, juste pour justifier la présence de receleurs. Surprenant aussi qu'ils acceptent inexplicablement de racheter sans broncher des denrées 100% avariées et invendables, (car dorénavant toxiques...)
Bref.

Contrairement à d’autres, je ne pense pas que les patchs feront de miracle : même si les problèmes les plus graves finissent peut-être un jour par se régler, je crains que Kingdom Come Deliverance ne reste à jamais un jeu à problèmes, mal optimisé, et pété de bugs. Tout simplement parce que l'équipe trop ""neuve"" de Warhorse, bien qu’hyper attachante, n’a (à mon sens) absolument pas les moyens de ses ambitions.

Ce jeu est si énorme que c'était trop casse-gueule comme ""1er projet"".
Au fil des vidéos de développement, la sympathique équipe affichait sa motivation passionnée, mais manifestement ils voyaient systématiquement ""trop grand"" pour tout, et semblaient de plus en plus incapables de respecter leurs promesses intenables, malgré les efforts & les moyens monumentaux mis en œuvre.
C'est le piège de proposer des objectifs kikstarter irréalisables : je les regardais s'éparpiller, distribuer leurs épées forgées, et vendre leur bière et leurs T-shirts ""Warhorse"" avec le fric des backers, tout en sacrifiant le perso féminin jouable (objectif pourtant financé au pallier de 600000 balles je précise)...
Ils semblaient à la fois surpris et déjà dépassés par les promesses qu'engageaient l'argent qui tombait sans cesse, les obligeant à fournir toujours ""plus"" en un temps non-extensible... Les bêtas accumulaient les signes de mauvais augure, avec à chaque fois la promesse que tout serait corrigé en version finale.

À présent que l’heure du bilan sonne, la release semble presque tourner moins bien que les premières alphas! Même si à ses débuts, le jeu intriguait précisément à cause de son esthétique exceptionnelle, certaines zones urbaines déçoivent graphiquement en comparaison des irréprochables forêts à la végétation absolument splendide.
Malgré d'indiscutables progrès depuis les 1eres démos jouables, les animations (hors cinématiques) sont toujours trop raides, les chevelures toujours aussi peu naturelles, et les maisons encore trop ""vides"" : une déconcertante alternance de splendide & de médiocre...

[b]Cependant, bien que toutes mes craintes sur l’aspect technique dramatique de ce jeu se vérifient malheureusement en version finale, un vrai petit miracle intervient, car cette MONTAGNE de tares n’empêche bizarrement en rien le jeu de s’avérer passionnant et hypnotisant![/b]

Le sound design impeccable, les musiques somptueuses, les éclairages magnifiques et l’excellence de l’acting des doublages français suffisent à donner une consistance agréable à l’ambiance hyper réussie! L'immersion est géniale: on s'y croit!
L’écriture des dialogues est d’excellente facture, ainsi que leur version française, fort bien écrite. Les quêtes sont intéressantes et bien amenées, le scénario réaliste est également bien foutu, et extrêmement documenté : chacune de vos découvertes amènera une entrée vers l’exhaustif codex, qui vous enseignera nombre de choses sur le folklore local, le contexte historique, les personnages de l’époque, ou tout simplement les rouages du jeu... Monumental!

J’apprécie énormément que les ""AAA"" soient livrés SANS DRM, (sur GoG), et rien que ce détail mérite à mes yeux d’être récompensé et rémunéré!
L'ouverture au modding est providentielle, car je pense que ce sont en réalité les moddeurs qui sauveront ce jeu - et à vrai dire, ils ont déjà commencé : Quand au bout de 2h le système de save pourri m’est devenu trop insupportable, j'ai installé un mod de save infinies via Nexus, qui fonctionne impeccablement : magique de pouvoir corriger dès la sortie une mécanique potentiellement rédhibitoire!

Le jeu fourmille d'idées géniales, comme de gérer l'influence de la saleté du personnage dans ses rapports avec autrui, (indépendamment des taches de sang sur vos armes et armures qui, elles, susciteront plutôt la crainte).

L’inventaire comme la feuille de stats sont ergonomiques, tout comme la splendide map très informative.
Les illustrations aux allures d’enluminures médiévales sont magnifiques, et voir la tronche de Daniel Vávra sur un PNJ est juste priceless!

Ce jeu allie donc très paradoxalement un souci du détail hallucinant, et un je-m'en-foutisme difficilement acceptable sur le plan technique qui malheureusement gâche beaucoup l'immersion (c'est à dire sa principale qualité), et pour ça, il mériterait un pouce rouge!
Mais dans la mesure où je l'adore, je le recommande naturellement malgré ses pénibles tares.

0,steam_reviews/384110_PathologicClassicHD.json,3173,4,"I played and finished all routes not on steam so my hours would be a lot more in actuality, and I am not proud of that. It'd be like. 80 hours. also this review alludes to some spoilers maaaybe

Quickest breakdown I can think of, it's essentially every Bulgakov and Kafka book merged into one hallucinogenic mess that has you clinging on for dear life every second OR contemplating the futility of your actions and the guilt/loss as a result of your existence, except it has the sickest soundtrack ever. No game comes close. It's surreal and very inquisitive! One may complain about the revealed plot twist but I think it brings up the beautiful question of what art truly means to us- we are just like those children, we play with the dolls of our creation and when they begin to bother us or we lose interest in their story we discard them, not once thinking about the sick game we've subjected them to because they're not real, are they? And yet in holding them with your own hands, coursing your own experiences into their forms made of wood and crinkling sawdust, or in this case, pixels and tons of concept art, we feel for them, truly. We feel the remorse and shame that they're subjected to, and we dare to cringe at their wounds when we're the ones that laid them upon them, it's all very frighteningly real for something of our imagination, or at least us participating in another's imagination. This game has meaning because you put yourself into it, not because it's tragically written and gorgeously composed. You find solace in this bizarre world with your own emotion. 

Another good thing is there's a lot to think about AS you play the game, not after. It breaks away from the constant cycle we see in other games, a 'do this and you receive instant gratification' type of system, instead Pathologic really makes you wallow in the themes as you walk around, doing meticulous and often times vague errands. Maybe it's difficult for people who don't come to games to be presented with ideas and have conflicting emotions stirred within them. We often view games as the lowest form of media, because it feeds off short attention spans and human want to receive satisfaction without having to work for it. We don't see it as art that has so much work put into it, we think of it as something like quick, fast-paced short-form content that works to enrapture us in its jaws. Games are much longer than 10-second clips, yes, but they don't feel long. You're constantly bombarded with information and positive feedback. And that's not a bad thing all the time, we listen to feel-good music to cheer us up or read certain types of books to make us feel happy and joyful. But just as we have thoughtful books and music to really make us contemplate, we can do the same with games as well! Pathologic brings a riveting, challenging view to how we normally think of games. It brings back the notion that art doesn't have to be beautiful or gratifying to a modern audience with a modern template, and it excels in doing so.",429,english
0,steam_reviews/384110_PathologicClassicHD.json,3173,4,"This is one of the few games that made me ultimately conclude that video games are not simply a matter of entertainment but can also be art in the purest sense of the word. One of the reviewers shouts in his review, which I read before playing, several times things like ""can you see the genius?!"" - and although I only had enough time in the last weeks to gather about 5 hours, I can indeed see the genius. But it is more than just seeing it, I can feel it when inside this bleak steppe world. The dialogues and the presentation are sometimes so poetically beautiful and full of mystery, it made me wonder if the developers brought Gustav Meyrink and Franz Kafka back to life, melted them into a single mind of atmospheric genius and just exhausted themselves to somehow realize its vision through coding.
If this would've been a book in the 1920's it would be of world fame, unfortunately it is the work of a small and unknown team - this situation rendered it horribly unrecognized. 
If you can somehow arrange yourself with the gameplay, which is sometimes a bit awkward (but never a real pain), buy and play this game. Or maybe wait for the remake, which is coming soon as far as I know. Even though I haven't even completed a single campaign by now, it struck something deep inside of me and I am very glad to have supported the devs and experienced their creation.",1765,english
0,steam_reviews/384110_PathologicClassicHD.json,3173,4,"The most intelligent game I have played. A multilayered storyline experienced through three different characters, with a plot that is rich as a classic novel from Dostoyevsky or Kafka. And ofcourse as heavy as a Dostoyevsky novel, so prepare for a lot of reading and existential dread. 

The mechanics of the game in survival, reputation, and communication makes the game feel unique and draws you in to the world. Along with the atmosphere from the music, environments, plague districts. Again, amazing, but more existential dread.

A few drawbacks. Walking through the map becomes tedious, particularly if you want to check in on your 'bound' inbetween quests. Combat is okay but a bit unfair for Changling. And who exactly designed those plague clouds? I want to meet them.

Highly recommend this if you want the full experience of the game, but if you want some major quality of life improvements that makes the game more... player friendly, look at Pathologic 2.",2058,english

Çünkü dlcler'in aşırı bir güzelliği yok ve gene Türklere değer vermeyen bir oyun . Tabiki konumuz  Türkçe dil olayı felan değil evet bu kötü bir durum ama devlet ilgilenmedikçe Türkçe dil gelmeyecek gibi neyse ana değer vermeme konusuna geçelim . Sen sibirya git eskiden orda yaşamış halkları yap ama Türkleri moğol yap Saha Yakut Türklerini moğol yap o Türkünü şu Türkünü Moğal yap . Sonra da gel Türklerden destek bekle malesef nah destek veririz . Ayrı bir konu ise İstanbul Beşiktaş'ta Türk kurgan mezarları ortaya çıktı sen daha Tarihini tam bilmediğin bir şehrin tamamını Yunan yap . (Kurgan mezar çıkmasının sebi İskitlerin içlerindeki bir kaç Türk boyunu ve Kafkaslardaki boyları Türkleştirip oraya yollaması ve İyon şehirlerinin atası olması ) Neyse ki yeni oyun Güney Amerika'da çıkacak .

Ama şöyle şeyler var oyunun parkur yapısı AC'ye oranla çok daha zor bir tuşa yanlış basmanız oyun zevkininizin içine s*çabiliyor . AC belli tuşlara bastıktan sonra arkadaşı rahat bırakıp mousela dönseniz bile her şeyi çok rahat yapabiliyorsunuz ama bunda 'E' tuşunu çok dikkatlı kullanmanız lazım . Hatta size bir tavsiye ne yaptığınızı biliyorsanız E'ye sakın basmayın ama bilmiyorsanız E tuşuna abanabilirsiniz . Oyunun hikayesinme gelelim . Oyunun hikayesi açıkcası diğer macere oyunları kadar güzel değil ...

First of all thanks to Bloober Team, I had amazing 2 hours so far! I really don't often feel the urge to write a review but this EA game just blew my mind.

Visuals:

First of all I am very impressed by the visuals (especially considering this is based on the unity engine which is not often referred to as being this good) and the overall quality of the game so far. 
The ...often... disturbing images are crisp and clean and the effects implemented so far simply look and feel right and stunning. Unfortunately my GTX 770 is not able of calculating my native screen resolution of 3440x1440 above 30fps constantly (no prroblem if you're running on full HD though and have a comparable gfx card).

Sound:

Can you please do a bit WORSE in the final product? It's just ... too good?! Music is placed where music should be in this genre, it's subtle and more often absent than present. But in case you hear some ambient music tones you can breathe again because just for a few seconds you might overhear the super creepy background noises like creaking wood and a childs steps echoing through narrow corridors. 

Why we love games like these!

Layers of Fear plays with the Lovecraftian kind of horror, the horror in your mind playing tricks with you. Scaring you even though you're not constantly pushed by visuals but rather sound and pure atmospheric immersion. Spiced up with the idea of (japanese silent hill'ish) shocking moments this game has what it needs to be on a par with P.T..
What I really like about Layers of Fear so far is that it is not gritty or disgusting as the The Evil Within or Outlast approach to scare the **** out of us players. It is the Stephen King like approach of telling a story in a very psychological almost Kafkaesque style. I guess the first Amnesia would be a good comparison if you really need one.

In any case I can highly recommend this game (so far) and will definitely play the rest of it but for today... no more redwine and its 11 pm here anyway. Good night and sweet dreams!

PS: English is not my native language in case you find grammatical inconsistencies feel free to keep them. :)",495,english

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"One of the worst games I have probably played in the past year. Easily the most ""meta"" point-and-click puzzle game of all time, and it's horrible for it. Extremely shallow and short.

The game just throws random passing references about Franz Kafka but isn't really much about him or his themes. It just brings up certain details or pieces of his work, like Metamorphosis, but does not make anything sensible about all of this. The whole experience is just random absurdity for the hell of it, and it's not even ""fun"" absurdity.

The plotline is almost non-existent, as said above. The dialogue is just awkward and boring, and in fact takes up probably 50% of the game time or more, given how slow it progresses, and you having to click specific bubbles as they pop up across the screen.

The other 50% of the game is a collection of ""puzzles,"" but I'd even say half of those are not real puzzles. A good chunk of them simply involve randomly clicking around the screen until you find something you can interact with that might not seem obvious, then bashing in multiple attempts to get some event to occur.

Very rarely are the puzzles intuitive, and most don't give you a sense of accomplishment or an ""Aha!"" moment, but more so make you wonder ""What the hell was the developer thinking?"" Just because the game is acting like it's focused on Kafka doesn't make any of this better.

Earlier I said it is short, and I [b]really[/b] mean it. The first attempt took me less than 1 hour, and I decided to rush through it again to see how much actual ""content"" exists. If I immediately canceled most of the dialogue as it showed up, it only took ~20-25 minutes to get through the entire game again!

Honestly, I think the developers are selling this over the art style and some fake sense of dedication to Kafka, when really there's almost nothing worthwhile in this creation.",120,english

Разработчик Denis Galanin (mif2000) в очередной раз подарил мне бурю эмоций и расшевелил мои извилины своей профессионально выполненной работой, которая воплощена в игру The Franz Kafka Videogame. Если сказать, что это простая инди игра или головоломка, значит проявить лукавство и недооценить проделанную работу. Игра, на которую вы сейчас будете читать обзор, достойна внимания за свой уникальный сюжет и по-настоящему увлекательные ребусы. Ранее я уже писал обзор на игру от этого разработчика - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/YroMIR/recommended/222160] Hamlet[/url], где также восхитился результатом.

Во вторую очередь, надо отметить, что Издателем, который содействовал появлению на свет игры The Franz Kafka Videogame, является студия – всеми известная Daedalic Entertainment, подарившая нам такие творения, как Deponia, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/YroMIR/recommended/366910/] The Long Journey Home[/url] и многие, многие другие! Я до сих пор, если честно, не встречал плохих игр от указанного издателя. И лишний раз, на примере работы Дениса Галанина убедился в этом.

[h1]Сюжет[/h1]

Сюжетом игры является приключение главного героя K. , который стремится решить дилемму, созданную отчасти им и обстоятельствами, но финал у этой истории совсем не такой, как вы будете представлять! Интрига положена?

Примечательно, что в игре очень много «пасхалок» из трудов написанных Францом Кафка. Самого героя зовут К. , также стоит непременно сказать об образах, которыми наполнена игра и совсем уж очевидно, что сюжетные части игры коррелируются с трудами Франца Кафки (особо упертым, посмотрите название его сочинений и основные вехи игры). Именно поэтому игра «по мотивам произведений», а не основана на произведениИ. 

Сам сюжет немного сюрреалистичен, местами находится вне повседневного понимания, но в течение его развития – постижим и прост. Когда играешь в эту игру, то не покидает ощущение некой сказки, некого мира трансцендентного, где все же сопереживаешь Герою, сопереживаешь его приключениям. Сами приключения интригующие и чарующие, так бы описал.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1402191266

[h1]Графика[/h1]

Любая головоломка должна иметь логические задачи, которые трудно решить нахрапом, но когда все это анимировано, живет по своим законам, колышется, тогда, лично мне, не удержать восторга. В игре меня почти мгновенно подкупил тот факт, когда в дверь вошел второстепенный персонаж - женщина. Сразу стало понятно, что графическая составляющая меня будет радовать на протяжении всего процесса. Я о том, что точность и форма передачи на высоте, соответствует реальности – эта барышня плыла по воздуху, характерно перемещаясь из стороны сторону. 

А эти бесподобные образы героев, которые имеют каждый свою сущность, воплощенную во внешнем облике? Краски, которыми художник стремится передать атмосферу происходящего! Лично мне все по нраву. Посмотрите только на образ возлюбленной К. Крайне достойно! И так воссоздана вся игра.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1402191320

[h1]Геймплей[/h1]

Игра относится к жанру головоломки, где результатом ваших решений будет продвижение по сюжету, вашему приключению с последующим результатом в виде финала. Уровень головоломок крайне высок. Местами очень сложно сообразить логику автора головоломки, НО в защиту скажу, что ЛЮБОЙ человек – это Вселенная, поэтому когда вы разгадываете тот или иной ребус – это значит, вы постигаете Вселенную автора, что создал данный ребус. Это прекрасно. 

В игре есть подсказки, они открываются со временем. Их всего две на уровень, если первая вам намекает на ход логики, согласно которому вам надо следовать, то вторая дает полный результат прохождения ребуса. Лично у меня не возникало проблем пройти очень сложные ребусы за счет подсказок.

[b]Рекомендации по игре: [/b]
[list]
    [*] Рекомендую кликать на все, что вы видите, что покажется странным. Вероятно, здесь и кроется часть головоломки.
    [*] Имейте ввиду, ачивку «Эрудит» лучше делать сразу. Она дается за просмотр всех подсказок на всех уровнях. На мой взгляд так удобней, но я не настаиваю )))))
[*] Иногда головоломки не так очевидны, как вам может показаться. Например, вы встретите пятнашки. С ними не все так просто, просто учтите, что логика не прямая в этой игре.
[/list]

[h1]Звук и музыка[/h1]

В игре разноплановая музыка, она на всех уровнях создает тот самый фон, который настраивает вас на ту или иную волну. Как по мне, это очень грамотный и верный ход. Я вообще всегда говорил и буду говорить, что если нет нормального звукового сопровождения игрового процесса, то этот продукт сам себя приговорил. Это, как старая кляча, которая стремится на ипподроме быть первой, но результат мы с вами можем предугадать заранее, так вот! Эта игра очень толково наполнена музыкой и звуками. В процессе не возникало у меня ощущения оторванности от визуального ряда, я наоборот уходил в него все глубже и глубже. 

[h1]Послесловие[/h1]

Данная игра обязательная к ознакомлению, прохождению, а также ее не грех советовать всем, кто так или иначе любит данный жанр, Кафку или просто ищет качественную игру. Для меня, если честно, удивление, что подобного рода игры невостребованны людьми. Игра бесподобна!

Единственное, за что можно и нужно снять балл этой игре, так это за то, что она в ребусах использует неоднократно английские слова. Считаю это не корректным по отношению к потребителю конечного продукта, т.к. не все владеют языком, пусть слова и обыденные. В русской локализации можно было бы их заменить аналогом. Здесь мне кажется, просто поленились , в итоге минус 1 балл.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"The thing about puzzle adventures is that the player and the creator have to ""click"", sharing a common logic. There's nothing more satisfying than moving to a new location in an adventure game and having something weird pop up at you, feeling that warm rush of a eureka moment. Catching the end of the line that needs to be unravelled, discovering a discrepancy, and consequently solving a puzzle is incredibly satisfying.

Unfortunately, none of this happened with me and TFKV. Almost every single puzzle felt esoteric in a bad way, offering zero clue as to how to move forward and zero satisfaction upon solving, demanding trial and error at best or just waiting for a hint to pop at worst. Heck, in some cases I used both hints and they helped me none! (Like in the WWI puzzle, where I quickly realized that shapes meant letters, but had no clue as to what word I was supposed to spell.) I get it that the puzzles in TFKV are supposed to make one think out of the box, but to me, they ended up being just... random.

""Random"" is perhaps [i]the[/i] word to describe TFKV. The game tries very very hard to throw surreal imagery at you, but, while the visuals are very lovely and well-executed, I'm not sure how placing a level in the Black Lodge is supposed to make the game more interesting. I mean, yeah, I've seen Twin Peaks too... so? What was the point of this reference?

And, of course, the Franz Kafka aspect. Going in, you have to keep in mind that TFKV is colorful, light-hearted, and has a dog sidekick. Any references to Franz Kafka's work are purely superficial and pop-cultural. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily—there's nothing wrong with shifting genres.

Just keep in mind that this puzzle adventure game about Franz Kafka has very esoteric puzzles and has little to do with Franz Kafka,",226,english

This is the kind of video game where players either fall in love with the art & narration style and the absurdity, or you cannot see anything more than just a random collection of strange and quick puzzles.

[h1]Long version:[/h1]
Despite what many would think, ‘The Franz Kafka Videogame’ is not an adaptation of Kafka’s works but more like a game that feels like as if a contemporary Kafka created it. His trademark surrealism saturates through every layer, from plot to puzzle design.

From a technical aspect, this one is exactly like mif2000’s previous video game project, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/222160/]Hamlet[/url]: a touchscreen-friendly puzzle game that relies solely on interacting with scene elements. Its unique selling point is the so outlandishly Kafka-like solutions that would make even early 90s adventure games look sane in comparison.

Some players will absolutely love this surreal approach, while others will see nothing more than a bunch of disjointed and short puzzles. Therefore, definitely buy this if you enjoy pure weirdness, but if you do not, then it is unlikely you will find any entertainment value here.",242,english
0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"День добрый, доводилось вам иметь знакомство с творчеством Франца Кафки? При любых обстоятельствах The Franz Kafka Videogame является весьма спорной игрой, имеющей кучу положительных качеств, но и без минусов в современном мире никуда.

Если говорить прямо, то The Franz Kafka Videogame можно назвать сборником разноплановых загадок и головоломок, объединенных между собой абсолютно бредовым сюжетом, который так и пестрит всевозможными отсылками и пасхальными яйцами на произведения знаменитого писателя. Творчество Кафки полнится сюрреализмом и абстрактным видением привычных вещей, а игра неуклюже делает попытку визуализировать данный стиль, правда некоторые вещи практически невозможно перенести со страниц на экраны, что подтверждали многочисленные провалы с экранизациями различных произведений.

И все же играть в The Franz Kafka Videogam довольно интересно и весело, разве что некоторые из головоломок настолько странные, что найти решение для их преодоления практически невозможно, а это уже решительно бьет по самолюбию и настроению играющего человека. Если же вы сможете осилить все закоулки этого безумия без использования подсказок и подглядывания в прохождение, то я буду аплодировать Вам стоя.

Визуально игра очень радует! Приятная палитра цветов, интересный стиль рисовки локаций и персонажей, плавная анимация происходящего. Мы практически смотрим старый мультфильм, который греет сердце одним своим существованием. К звуку тоже нет никаких претензий. Мелодичные композиции, удачное оформление сюжетных поворотов и плавный переход при смене кадра.

В итоге The Franz Kafka Videogam сделана на совесть, но определенно не для всех, впрочем, как и творчество самого Франца, так что я не смею ругать игру за балаган идей и отсутствия логики в происходящем. Что печалит, так это короткое время для прохождения игры. С учетом томительного изучения некоторых головоломок, друзья, игра была пройдена всего за часа полтора, ну может чуть больше, что лично для меня является несомненным плюсом, а вот для большинства любителей хороших игр-отнюдь.
Я даже не знаю кому можно искренне посоветовать данную игру к прохождению. Разве что заядлым фанатам писателя, а может и любителям сложных головоломок, так что держитесь предоставленной информации и сделайте этот выбор самостоятельно, авось именно вам игра откроет все свои тайны, а логические задачки покажутся проще пареной репы, удачи!

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Kafka was anything but random, but this game sure is.

It seems that the creator of the game had no clue what Kafka is really all about. Sure, there are plenty of absurdities in the writings of one of the best authors of all time, that one might find random, but they are grotesque and unsettling, they will make you feel insignificant, helpless and powerless against the weight of the system. They serve a purpose.
Here everything is just random without any real purpose. What's the deal with the monkey-detective? Or the astronaut, that we never see again? Random things just happen and we're done with them for ever. The whole game seems completely amateur and lacks focus. You can't just pass that as Kafkaesque, it doesn't work that way.

The story has very little to do with Kafka, except that the protagonist of the story, named simply K. is involved in events that are beyond his own control and tries to find the way out of it, which is Kafkaesque, I must admit. There are some twists and turns, but overall, not too much of a story at all. Stretched over 4 chapters, the whole script probably took no more than 2 regular pages, including the dialog. The events don't connect to each other much. Random things just happen and nothing really makes any sense or has any purpose.

The characters are non existent, even the main protagonist has no personality whatsoever. I have hard time to say anything else about any of them, because there is nothing to say. There is a dog, fallowing K. for some reason.

You might think that this is a short game and a single person effort, so how much of a story and character development I should expect?
But short games, and even games that were made by a single person can be good or even great games: Milkmaid of the Milky Way is a great example, Gemini Rue is a single person effort, while not exactly short, Fran Bow was developed by a team of 2, I'm yet to play The Darkside Detective, but I've heard it's great. The thing is, I bought this game because I knew it's short, I love short games. If I have just one evening a month, that I can spend point-and-clicking, there is nothing better for me than a 2-4 hour game.

Sure, short, small team games might not have it all, maybe the story is not so interesting, perhaps puzzles are somewhat weak, but there must be something that makes them worthwhile. I could forgive a lot if there is at least one aspect in the game that stands strong. In fact, I wouldn't mind anything that's wrong with this game, if puzzles were half decent.

But the puzzles in this game are downright annoying! They have absolutely nothing to do with the game itself, they are just a very amateur way of dragging this game longer than it should have been. Of course, the number sliding puzzle has to be in there, how else are you going to show your lack of creativity? Here is an idea: instead of creating some real puzzles as obstacles to overcome, why not simply depict going somewhere as a board game that has nothing to do and doesn't tie in any way with the rest of the game?

Most of these puzzles can be solved simply by clicking and dragging things around. There are no complex puzzles, all of them will have hints in the same screen that you're in. In fact, you're unable to walk back, so you're always on one screen until you progress. There are no inventory or items to make things more interesting. Sometimes you might not know exactly what you're supposed to be doing, but just click enough things around and you'll get there.

Other times, I failed to find the logic behind the puzzles whatsoever. Sure, there were hints for most of them, but they still made no sense. There was a puzzle with a toy monkey, you drag the string, the monkey plays the drums. Notice the number on the hat and play the drums to represent that number. I get it, but in what way does that make any sense? Why would there be something when we played the correct sequence? It's just random and it really started to pissed me off. 

The newspaper ad and train puzzles seemed like simple brute force puzzles to me. Perhaps I just wasn't looking hard enough, but it looked like there's all there is to them. The signature puzzle made no sense. Why would hitting X not print the X, but rather part of the letter K?! The first lock puzzle, made absolutely no sense as well, there was an obvious clue for the number, but there wasn't any clue for what those letters represent. And to think of it, why does the lock have the number that represents the combination printed on it?! It's just very very lazy.

Other than great looks, this game has not much to offer. The story feels rushed and out of focus. The puzzles are just lazy, uncreative, unimaginative and sometimes felt plain annoying. There are no characters worth mentioning, the story is weak and the twist at the end is just lazy too.",130,english
0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"[h2]Mixed rating, hmmm[/h2]
Why? Nothing technical atleast. It's probably because the puzzles are not logical, or better said, not logical in the average mind. To understand that, you have to vaguely know who this Kafka is, because I certainly didn't know. 
[i] Wikipedia: 1883-1924 (Austria) novelist/short story writer. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.[/i]
Aha, so only people familiar with German literature would have known about him. 

The puzzles are indeed very surreal, normally I find that frustrating, but since it's the theme of this game, I didn't really mind. The game offers a hint after three minutes, and a second one after five minutes during each puzzle. Most of the time you can't really solve it without the hint, but it's nice to give your surrealistic facets of your mind a try. 

Because this is a short game, I recommend a playthrough through this nonsense. The drawings aren't bad, neither is the music. I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but atleast now I know who Franz Kafka is. 

64/100

[i]NB: I did three full playthroughs for the achievement 'unaided', but I can't seem to get it. If anyone knows what I am doing wrong, tell me please! I didn't check the hints, made sure every scene was finished within three minutes. I seem to be the only one with this problem, so it must be me... [/i]",701,english

Игра в первую очередь заинтересовывает интересным стилем, а также историей непростого, на мой взгляд, писателя Кафки, но что скрывается за всем этим? 

От The Franz Kafka Videogame у меня осталось весьма двоякое впечатление. С одной стороны, интересная задумка о чертогах бессознательного, в которых скрывается самое потаенное и причудливое. С другой стороны, тот психодел, который происходил на экране, напомнил картины [u][url=https://yandex.ru/images/search?text=Сальвадора%20Дали%20в%20стиле%20сюрреализм]Сальвадора Дали в стиле сюрреализм[/url][/u]. Происходящее сильно меня оттолкнуло. Скажу честно, допрошла игру с трудом, но думаю, лишь потому, что творчество Кафки мне не близко, хотя преследовала обратную цель - проникнуться и разобраться в нем, но видно не судьба.

Плюсы

    [*]Стоимость. На мой взгляд, платить полную цену за 1,5 часа, весьма дорогое удовольствие.
    [*]Время прохождение.

К сожалению, The Franz Kafka Videogame немного не оправдала моих надежд. История мистера К. во многом основана на отсылках к работам Франца Кафки, который мне совершенно не по душе. И, конечно, резал, как по-живому, тот факт, что он никогда не был психотерапевтом, а лишь писателем с непростой судьбой. 

[u] Игра понравится[/u] тем, кто знаком с творчеством Кафки и проникнулся им до глубины души, а также для тех, кому было бы с ним интересно познакомиться. Для остальных, я скорее бы посоветовала игру пропустить мимо.

Механика игры довольно простая, мы имеем комнаты-головоломки, связанные общим сюжетом. Задачки попадаются самые разные, от абсурдно простых до довольно сложных.Там же, где привычная логика не действует, на помощь, естественно, приходит логика абсурдная. В экстренных ситуациях существует система подсказок, однако продумана она довольно здорово. Подсказки начинают появляться только через строго определенное время, как бы намекая: «Ну подумай еще минутку». Иногда именно в эту минуту решение и находится. Часто задачи оказываются довольно абстрактными, а подсказки на них запутают еще больше. Но в целом мир продуман так, чтобы вы не задерживались на головоломках слишком уж долго.

So..the game is very surreal. At it's heart, this is nothing more than a very difficult puzzle game, but there are alot of easter eggs giving credit towards Franz Kafka's books. For example, many of the levels actually hint at his books. Anyways, here is my pro/con list:

PROS:

-If your in the mood for surrealism, this is the game for you.
-Some of the puzzles are very hard core. I find difficult puzzles to be a good place to flex your brain muscle.

CONS:

-The game is too short.
-If you don't like puzzles, avoid this game.

Just a small puzzler game with Franz Kafka book influence. I enjoyed the puzzle aspect and the surrealism. I recommend this for the fact the game is a puzzler that is surrealistic.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"""The Franz Kafka Videogame"" ist ein winziges, touchscreenorientiertes Rätselspielchen.

Eines vorweg: mit Franz Kafka - dem genialen Jahrhundertautor - hat dieses Spielchen so gut wie gar nichts zu tun. Auch wenn die Hauptfigur Herr K. und seine Verlobte Felice genannt wird, er sich auf die Reise nach Amerika macht, alle Referenzen bleiben unverstandene Oberfläche oder pennälerhafte Dreistigkeit.

Stattdessen wir in dieses Rätsel-Spielchen alles hineingeworfen, was offenbar das Kriterium erfüllt, möglichst wenig mit Franz Kafka zu tun zu haben. Matisse wird ebenso bemüht wie Lewis Carroll oder Sigmund Freud. Nur um mal Letzteres zu klären: die Psychoanalyse dürfte Kafka zwar notiert haben, er interessierte sich dafür aber überhaupt nicht und seine Werke mit Freud überhaupt in Verbindung zu setzen, ist Beweis genug, daß man nichts verstanden hat. 

Das Spiel selber besteht übrigens aus einer beliebig zusammengewürfelten Abfolge meist recht simpler Rätsel, die in der Regel auch durch Trial and Error-Geklicke zu lösen wären. Einen Sinn ergibt die chaotische Abfolge zusammenhangloser Rätsel nicht. Und offenbar meint der Autor, daß dieses Zusammenhanglose, Sinnbefreite irgendetwas mit Kafka oder dem, was der Autor wohl unter kafkaesk verstehen mag, zu tun hat. Auch surreale Elemente werden wild hineingemischt, in völliger Verkennung dessen, was sowohl Surrealismus als auch kafkaesk meint. 

Die recht nette comichafte Grafik vermag dann auch nicht mehr über diese bodenlose Peinlichkeit hinwegtäuschen. Ungelenke Rätsel eingebettet in eine beliebig wirr chaotische Abfolge von Pseudo-Referenzen, die nichts mit dem Titelgebenden zu tun haben: damit hat uns der Autor jeden Denkenden schon mit seinem ""Hamlet"" beleidigt. Das hier ist aber nochmal eine Schippe drauf, denn wo ""Hamlet"" noch völlig referenzlos war, tut ""The Franz Kafka Videogame"" immer wieder so, als würde es irgendetwas inhaltliches und kafkaeskes erzählen wollen. Und deutlich schlimmer als platte Niveaulosigkeit ist immer noch eine rein behauptete Intellektualität, die sich als komplettes Unvermögen erweist.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Malgré tout le respect que je peux avoir pour les développeurs du monde entier et particulièrement ceux de TFKV, je ne peux que m’interroger quant à la cohérence d’un tel jeu.
Le premier problème vient d’une évidence : tout ceci n’a aucun rapport avec l’oeuvre de Kafka, ce n’est pas parce qu’on y retrouve des allusions à des personnages et qu’on y cite des œuvres, que le rapprochement peut se faire. C’est aussi malhonnête qu’affirmer que la série Twilight est inspirée du roman de Bram Stoker ; mis à part le fait qu’on croise des êtres immortels aux dents longues dans les deux, tout sépare les deux univers.
Le visuel est également en totale inadéquation avec l’oeuvre et les obsessions de l’auteur pragois, mais sur ce point, je veux bien admettre que c’est la vision personnelle de l’auteur, ça ne se discute pas.
On a donc un jeu qui cite Kafka sans en saisir la substance, qui le met en images de façon très personnelle ; tellement personnelle que personne ne peut y adhérer.
C’est un peu léger mais, soyons encore une fois indulgent, et passons au jeu en lui-même.
Il est très court, composé de quinze puzzles au fil d’une histoire… comment dirais-je… sans queue ni tête où on croise K lui-même, Felice Bauer ou Gregor Samsa… mais jamais que comme cameo, en quelque sorte. De decorum, rien de plus.
Quinze puzzles donc, c’est ce qui nous reste.
On parle de surréalisme et d’absurdité pour les définir… Absurde, certainement pas puisque logique il y a. Par contre, c’est surréaliste au sens strict du terme, mais pas au sens kafkaïen.
Des puzzles qui n’ont rien de « random » comme il est dit un peu partout dans les évaluations négatives. La logique est bien là et, comme pour les autres jeux de ce type, il faut tâtonner pour la dévoiler et résoudre les puzzles. Rien de plus, rien de moins.
Malgré tout ça, je ne peux me résoudre à ne pas recommander ce jeu.
Parce que j’aime ses graphismes et que je préférerais toujours une tentative (même maladroite) d’originalité à un devoir de fidélité bien rigoureux. Je mets une réserve sur la musique qui est de qualité mais me paraît peu immersive, peu… kafkaïenne. Mais c’est tout personnel.
Techniquement, attendez-vous à un jeu très court, avec des puzzles dont le sens de la logique vous surprendra probablement (les indices arrivent après un laps de temps et ne sont que des indices). Et puis, si vous êtes comme moi, vous apprécierez les graphismes (c’est éphémère, certes) en rêvant que le jeu ait été développé par un studio plutôt que par un garçon seul dans sa cuisine…",166,french

Indeed.

Creativity is obviously most welcome in a game of this genre, but this is so confusingly unconventional it creates a wholly unrewarding experience. Solving the puzzles becomes guesswork, often with no indication as to what is expected, while trying to figure out which parts of the interface are actually interactive.

That most actions are unique makes learning and improving impossible. Reaching the end only feels good in knowing that the antagonizing experience is over.

2) Die Rätsel sind nicht zu schwer, für Daedalic-Verhältnisse fand ich die meisten sogar eher leicht, aber viele Dinge lassen sich nur dadurch lösen, dass man random in der Grafik herumklickt, bis irgendwo irgendetwas passiert. Das sind keine Denk- sondern Geduldaufgaben.
3) Die Handlung hat so gut wie nichts mit Kafka zu tun. Es wirkt vielmehr, als wären die Namen und Figuren aus Kafkas Leben und Werk auf eine völlig generische Story gepappt worden. Überraschen surreal oder gar gruselig kafkaesk wirkt Handlung oder Spielwelt zu keinem Zeitpunkt.",104,german

Une bonne surprise ! J'ai vraiment passé un bon moment avec les puzzles proposés par les différents tableaux de ce jeu.
Un style graphique original et soigné, des énigmes qui peuvent sembler farfelues mais finalement bien pensées. Certaines m'ont même fait sourire lorsque j'ai compris leur sens.
Heureusement que des indices sont proposés, notamment pour trouver un mot qui ne me venait pas en anglais. Le jeu est disponible en français, je tiens à le préciser, mais la rare présence de mots dans les énigmes reste en anglais, rien d'insurmontable surtout si on jette un œil sur les indices.
Quant à son inspiration tirée des œuvres de Kafka, je ne peux me prononcer sur le sujet, je ne connais pas son univers.

[b][i]The Franz Kafka Videogame[/i] est un jeu à l'histoire qui peut sembler alambiquée, mais il se veut justement absurde et surréaliste. Et surtout, il propose un univers original et des énigmes bien sympas à résoudre.[/b]

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Jednym zdaniem: Franz Kafka Videogame to gra - jak sam tytuł wskazuje - nawiązująca do świata powieści jednego z najważniejszych pisarzy XX wieku - Franza Kafki i jego absurdalności. A atmosfery absurdu rodem z Procesu Kafki tutaj nie brakuje. Plus ciekawie zbudowane zagadki do rozwiązania. Franz Kafka, gdyby żył, to by polecił. :)

Plusy: 

+ mocno absurdalne klimaty 
+ ładna rysowana grafika
+ przyjemna muzyczka w tle 
+ czarne poczucie humoru 
+ liczne nawiązania do twórczości Kafki
+ zróżnicowane mapy oraz zagadki
+ przydatny system podpowiedzi (po czasie)
+ dużo fajnych pomysłów w grze

Minusy:

- fabuła jest dość pretekstowa
- gra jest trochę krótka (ok. 1,5 godz.)
- brak opcji graficznej vsync więc obraz troche pływa
- dość wysoki poziom trudności (chyba, że myślicie na poziomie absurdu)
- problematyczny 1 achievement

Komu polecam? / Komu odradzam?

+ polecam miłośnikom twórczości Franza Kafki 
+ polecam fanom absurdalnych klimatów
+ polecam fanom szukania ukrytych smaczków w grze 
- odradzam tym, którzy nie lubią przygodówek z zagadkami
- odradzam fanom gier logicznych, bo tutaj rządzi logika absurdu

Rada 1: 

Jeżeli nie czytaliście Procesu Kafki, to natychmiast zapraszam do lektury. A jeżeli już czytaliście... to wiecie czego się spodziewać i ta gra Was na pewno wciągnie. :)

Rada 2: 

Serio to nie jest gra logiczna (chociaż taką przypomina). To jest gra zbudowana w logice absurdu, więc realna logika nie ma tu zastosowania. ;)

Proč hříčku a nikoli hru? Protože vám to nezabere ani dvě hodiny času a nebýt jedné či dvou obrazovek, kdy není zcela jasné, co je cílem, tak bychom se bavili dokonce o hranici hodiny jedné.

 Nádherná surrealistická stylizace jednotlivých obrazovek zaujme na první dobrou a neokouká se až do konce; některé si vyloženě říkají o umístění na pracovní plochu počítače. Nápaditá hravost jednotlivých puzzlů pak nepřestavá překvapovat po celou dobu hraní; někdy se jede na vlně rozpustilého ""amanitího"" klikání a jindy zase na vlně variací na tradiční zapeklité hlavolamy. 

 Největším problémem tak krom (ne)délky, jednoduchosti a neurovnaného děje ode zdi ke zdi je zavádějící název. Pokud se totiž hra zaklíná v názvu předním představitelem existencialismu, tak by jeden přeci jen čekal něco poněkud jiného než takovouto rozjuchanou blbinu na jedno použití (jakkoli nesporně zábavnou), které s jeho dílem krom několika mála aluzí nemá žádné dočinění. Působí to spíše jako vychcanost tvůrce v podobě vějičky na čtenáře/hráče více než co jiného.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Twenty years ago, while I was in High School, I went to watch a stage play based on Kafka's Metamorphosis. It wasn't the first time I got to watch something bizarre, after all it was my last year and we were going to theater at least ten times a year in my cursus. I even got to watch an actor playing the statue of his character after its death, he stood completely naked on a pedestal, his body painted in white, for around half an hour without moving at all. I also went watching a whole Polish play which was subtitled (the translation was projected on a screen on top of the scene at the time), but nothing ever beat my experience with Metamorphosis.

Maybe because I never came to read one of Kafka's book before (the only one I tried at the time lost me after two chapters) or maybe because nothing made sense at all and there was no end. I remember that the actors took place and just looped their movements while a music was playing. There was a timid attempt to applause, which stopped as none of the missing actors were coming back on stage, then another, and finally people left, unsure if that was an intermission or just 30mn of loop before the true end would take place. I was there for school and had a work to do on that play, so like the rest of my class which was spread on the almost empty Opera that night, we stayed over 10mn at the end before deciding to leave. Probably a supplice for the tired actors who had to loop the bloody end and couldn't close the curtain because of fifteen stupidly lost students.

Why do I speak of this in a game review ? It's because I went through the game with the same feeling that I had at the time. It's beautiful, the acting is perfectly on point, but everything is nonsensical and you get out of it feeling extraordinary frustrated, like when someone tell you a joke that you don't understand while everybody is laughing around you and you force a chuckle to not look odd. 
That's what this ""game"" is, and worse as other people who know better Kafka's work than I do explain that the game has nothing to do with it beside some references left and right, that the nonsense of that whole game doesn't represent Kafka's work which isn't random like that game.

Here you're supposed to guess what mad idea the creators of the game had in mind when they made what they call puzzles and I call ""WTF is that"". Some things MAKE sense and some others will leave you without clue. It's to the point that the hint button on the top right not only will give you an hint after 3mn, but also the whole solution of the puzzle after 3 more minutes, as though they realized at some point that even with an hint, some stuff definitely doesn't make sense at all.

Non ho capito se l'autore, russo, vuole trollare le genti (ignoranti) o se fa sul serio... nel qual caso è ignorante lui (e di rimando le genti):
Qui di Kafka c'è ben poco, pochissimo (a parte il titolo), giusto qualche citazione o personaggio, per di più storpiato, cambiato... perde qualsiasi valore, non è più una citazione kafkiana. Tra queste, immancabile, ovviamente, Die Verwandlung (La metamorfosi)... e ti pareva: con tanto di rappresentazione antropomorfizzata dello scarafaggio (completamente fuori contesto, poi) al quale Kafka, tra l'altro, fu sempre assolutamente contrario.

Come se io verniciassi la mia Audi di rosso e la chiamassi ""La Ferrari""... perché ora ha lo stesso colore.
Follia.

Per il resto sono solo enigmi più o meno non-sense... senza aiuti l'ho finito in 2 ore scarse perché comunque, anche se senza senso, i livelli sono talmente scarni che basta cliccare su quel paio di opzioni disponibili e prima o poi la soluzione viene da sé. Il resto del tempo l'ho buttato per fare gli achievements... e poi mi sono addormentato ed è rimasto aperto il gioco tutte quelle ore ahahahaha... così gli ho fatto pure un favore, sembra chissà quanto longevo invece dura 2 ore scarse.

La cosa che più mi spaventa, comunque... sono le recensioni, stavolta anche quelle negative; ce ne fosse una che dica come stiano le cose, la maggior parte loda ""l'universo kafkiano"" del gioco. AHAHAH, ma 'n do' stà 'st'universo?? Figure di mèrda a profusione, su questa pagina, di centinaia di persone che hanno dato per scontato, dato il nome del prodotto, che le citazioni ci fossero realmente, o che fosse addirittura la sintesi di una delle opere di Kafka... mentre qui c'è il nulla assoluto e queste persone hanno solo dimostrato non solo la propria ignoranza... ma persino la loro meschinità.

Basterebbe leggersi la biografia di Kafka su wikipedia, non pretendo nemmeno che si sia letto qualcuno dei suoi libri, per capire quanto è truffaldino il titolo di questo gioco... tra l'altro ci sono citazioni più o meno dello stesso peso ma di altra ispirazione, che siano correnti stilistiche o derivanti da diversi artisti/epoche o universi narrativi/media (tipo il noir anni 30/40 o addirittura John Romero photobomber stile toasty guy di Mortal Kombat; ma perché?!); solo il periodo storico è lo stesso dello scrittore boemo ma poi nemmeno... ad un certo punto la data va ben oltre il 1924, quando Kafka (che cmq non andò mai in america) morì ancora giovane di tisi e si era già lasciato con Felice da anni, avendo avuto nel frattempo molte altre storie etc etc... tanto si potrebbe dire ma sarebbero parole sprecate.

Qui c'è solo un autore di ""videogiochi"" est-europeo (l'ho già detto ma lo ribadisco: tranne la CD Projekt, a destra della Germania dovrebbero lasciar perdere questo media, la loro concezione della vita li rende negati per tutto ciò) che, volutamente o meno non si sa, prende in giro un sacco di gente.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"If you choose a title like that, you have to expect some people to be disappointed. Live by the sword. Probably if you call your game, say, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/222160/]Hamlet[/url], people are less likely to say, ""What does it have to do with Shakespeare, and where's the drama, the wit, the masterful use of the language?"" It's more or less understood that the game just borrows the archetypal characters and situations and recycles them purely for amusement. That is really what FK does as well; strong writing or memorable characters are not what this game excels at.

FK is a puzzle game consisting of single-screen levels. There are 22 levels, although I may have miscounted by one or two. Some of the puzzles are Goblins-like -- or Amanita-like, which to me is the same thing -- where essentially you need to figure out the required sequence of clicks through the on-screen hotspots. Others are based around a single puzzle idea, where you just need to ""see"" the solution. And no, the game won't make you solve logic puzzles with convoluted rules or push sliding crates.

The whole shtick of the game is that its events and puzzles have their logic, but it's a surreal logic. That is, you're not left wondering why the puzzle solution worked at all, and the game is actually fairer with its puzzles than Hamlet was, but it's always Franz Kafka: Unexpected Juxtapositions (TM). This isn't going to appeal to everyone, but I think it makes for some very entertaining puzzles.

Overall, the puzzles were of average difficulty. If you've played Hamlet, you should know that the developer is fond of puzzles based around peculiar use of [spoiler]shapes[/spoiler], [spoiler]letters[/spoiler] and, of course, [spoiler]letter shapes[/spoiler] (only minor spoilers here, in case you're curious). You'll definitely recognize that style here. I had to use the built-in hints three times, and in one of those cases I was quite annoyed at myself for not figuring it out on my own. Always remember that some hotspots can be [spoiler]dragged[/spoiler] (minor-ish spoiler). That kept tripping me up. One puzzle involves a curtain that looks like it has a [spoiler]zipper[/spoiler] (not-so-minor spoiler), so that worked as a great hint. But other times the game just expects you to figure it out on your own.

The sound seemed to me to fit the game just right. Mostly the game has ambient sound instead of background music. It doesn't become repetitive or obtrusive, which is important for a game where you may need to spend quite some time in the same screen.

And, of course, it's all a treat to look at. It resembles the stylized visuals of Hamlet, but the graphics and the animations seem much richer. I wonder how much work went just into the origami puzzle. And was Cassandra trying to catch the train with her paw?

Das Spiel enttäuscht einen als Kafka-Fanatiker leider, mit ihm und seinen Werken an sich hat es wenig zu tun. Dabei ist das so schade, denn diese bieten weitaus mehr Potential für ein Spiel, das philosophisch-existenzielle Aspekte aufgreift, als ein solch eintöniges Point-and-Click-""Adventure"", das nur aus aneinander gereihten Rätseln besteht, die nebenbei bemerkt manchmal zu einfach waren und mit dem Surrealismus des Kafka wenig zu tun hatten. 
Sehr enttäuschend! Hatte mich ziemlich gefreut ein Spiel mit Franz Kafka im Titel entdeckt zu haben.
Allerdings ist klar, wenn man etwas Kafkaeskes erleben möchte, dann liest man einfach seine Werke.
 
Außerdem finde ich das Design zwar schön, aber unpassend für ein Spiel, das mit dem Namen Kafkas wirbt - es hat wahrlich nichts Kafkaeskes, Bedrohliches an sich. Scheinbar werden ganz willkürlich mitten im Spiel lateinische Redewendungen eingeworfen, die einen zunächst zum Prozessieren der Geschichte (die nicht einmal zusammenhängend ist) anregen sollen, sich später aber als leere Versprechungen entpuppen. 
Kafka würde sagen: ""Es gibt ein Ziel, aber keinen Weg. Was wir Weg nennen, ist Zögern."" Und ich habe oft gezögert während des Spiels! Ganz sporadisch blickte ich dann während der Rätsel Löcher in die Luft: ""Das kann nicht alles sein. Wo bleibt der ewige Frühling?""

El escritor bohemio Franz Kafka es una de las figuras del mundo literario que más interés ha despertado en las últimas décadas. Mundialmente reconocido, sus obras han sido adaptadas incluso a la gran pantalla como fue el caso de The Trial, dirigida por el mítico Orson Welles en el 62. Sin embargo, por primera vez en la historia nos encontramos ante una adaptación de las obras de Kafka al videojuego. Distribuido por Daedalic Entertainment y desarrollado por mif2000, vengo a hablarles de The Franz Kafka Videogame.

Como aficionada a la literatura kafkiana, me sorprendió muy gratamente el interés de un desarrollador en plasmar en un videojuego un mundo tan complicado y lleno de claroscuros, metáforas y acertijos como es el de Franz Kafka. El juego da comienzo en Bohemia, como no podría ser de otra manera, y a través de distintos sucesos terminamos siendo espectadores de un psicodélico viaje de Kafka por América con aspecto de una mezcla entre aventura gráfica sencilla –ni siquiera dispone de un inventario donde haya que recoger objetos clave– y juego de puzles demasiado sencillo. Y aquí es donde se cae con todo el equipo. Un juego demasiado simple para el tema que intenta tratar que no aporta nada nuevo en mecánicas y narrativa y que desgraciadamente se queda con los motivos más conocidos de las obras sin dar un paso más allá. El jugador “paseará” por el escenario interactuando algunas veces con distintos objetos e irán saltando puzles a resolver en diferentes ocasiones. Los puzles, si bien ingeniosos, se ven deteriorados en la diversión debido a la aparición de pistas para resolverlos en apenas un minuto; lo que impide que tengamos un rato más para devanarnos los sesos. Por otro lado, el juego puede resultar poco intuitivo incluso desde el inicio si no se quiere recurrir a las pistas.

Sin embargo, la documentación literaria que el juego ha debido tener detrás en su desarrollo es bastante rica. De hecho, una de las cosas que más me ha llamado la atención es el uso de juegos de palabras en puzles con referencias a “Alicia en el País de las Maravillas” de Lewis Carroll tanto en lo lingüístico como incluso poniendo directamente en escena personajes de la obra.

Otras referencias literarias que pueblan el título se relacionan con Bram Stoker y “Drácula” o con fábulas populares de Oriente, y crean un entramado maravilloso para aquellos que somos amantes de la literatura en todas sus formas.

Podrán pensar que es una estupenda idea que se adapte a un autor tan complicado de manera que cualquiera pueda acercarse un poco más a su obra y a su personaje. Pues sí, pero ¿realmente creen ustedes que una persona que no ha leído absolutamente nada de Kafka se va a gastar sus dineros en comprar The Kafka Videogame? Difícilmente.  Sin duda, la apuesta de su creador era muy arriesgada desde el principio aun siendo un pionero en adaptar la obra del escritor bohemio al videojuego y quizá la falta de referencias dentro del propio formato haya sido una de las piedras en el camino que ha impedido que se profundizase algo más para poder convertir el título en una experiencia única completa que además de divertir a los iniciados en el mundo kafkiano aportase cosas nuevas a los veteranos.

No obstante, mif2000 ya reinterpretó una de las obras maestras de Shakespeare, Hamlet, con resultados bastante buenos por parte de público y crítica. Puede ser que al nombrar el título con el nombre del autor en lugar de intentar adaptar una obra en concreto; el jugador, al esperarse algo más profundo y extenso, se ve decepcionado por la superficialidad y brevedad con que se tratan los temas. Lean a Kafka si quieren adentrarse en un mundo paralelo lleno de misterio e incongruencia aparente; respecto a la obra de mif2000, disfrútenla si ya conocen al escritor y, si no, al menos les abrirá una pequeña puerta a tan extravagante universo.",432,spanish

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"This is a delightfully surreal point and click adventure with wit, (somewhat obtuse) puzzles, and exceptional art/music. You control Kafka and Gregor at different points in the game and proceed through a series of scenes that span Europe and America. Accompanied by your dog, you encounter a variety of characters and click through dialog and puzzles.

Achievements are fairly straight forward, with one exception. Completionists will need to play the entire game through twice - once without using any hints and once using a hint on every screen. The rub on this is that hints do not become available until you've been in a scene for approximately 3 minutes.  There are a lot of scenes so the hint achievement becomes an exercise in idling!

After you have completed a scene, it becomes available to return to and restart at any point. You can quit playing and return right back to the scene from which you exited. Once you have finished the game, you will be returned to the last scene and can scroll backwards to find your desired reentry point. Individual scenes are fairly short so you will not lose much progress if you quit in the middle of something.

This is a very enjoyable, albeit short (perhaps 2-3 hours for a play through without hints), game that I would highly recommend to those who enjoy thoughtful puzzlers and dialog.details that will appeal to your intellect.

Die Rätsel passen zum Thema und dem Gesamtsetting, sie sind skurril und die Lösungen oft absurd. Ich hatte meinen Spaß daran, an der Lösung zu knobeln, die oft nur über Umwege erreichbar ist.

Die Geschichte in dem kurzen Spiel ist unglaublich bescheuert und absurd, was manche vielleicht mit kafkaesk gleichsetzen. Kafkas Protagonisten sind aber (kurz gesagt) einer höheren anonymen Macht (bspw. Staatsmacht) ausgeliefert, die undurchschaubar und beängstigend mittels ihrer Handlanger auf sie einwirkt. Damit hat das Spiel, denke ich, rein gar nichts gemein. Zeitweilig dachte ich eher an Sigmund Freud.

Das Ende hat mich unbegeistert zurückgelassen.

Die Rätsel reichen von nett bis seltsam. Ein paar sind vom Prinzip bekannt, ein paar haben ein gewisses Aha-Erlebnis. Zwei Rätsel habe ich nicht verstanden und habe auf die Hinweise gewartet, die ein paar Minuten später zur Verfügung stehen. Einige Rätsel sind nur mit Englischkenntnissen lösbar.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Do I ever try and like this game...


There are a great many issues that are hard to overlook and a great many subtle nuances I keep trying to convince myself are worthwhile canceling out the problems, but ultimately I can't...I just can't.

On first playthrough I was excited about the artstyle and potential subject matter... and upon delving in I was even more pleased with the small pieces of detail and pastice that are probably lost to most; be that the Scheele green walls, the SS Blumfeld (the elderly bachelor), and I did get so many giggles from the vulture wine advert; but so much of it was just so shallow and of no substance and concequence.   The more I tried to prove that was not the case to myself the more I found quotes and disclamers from the sources proving my wimsy wrong.

The kill screen bug and latin quotes first keyed me off... should a developer be telling us to err is human, should they be showing us a totally out of context broken coding screen... because they most definitely should not be telling us that it is better to never start a quest than have to concede...and that is what they said and how I felt. I was happy I played it, but it was not a proud happy and felt a little dirty thereafter.

The Strinberg style dream within a dream; and very obvious homage to David Lynch's ""waiting room"" give a little credence to my desire for this to be a complex causality and hope the puzzle's seeming brute force or superficaility were me missing something which would become self evident after discovering the outcome; but after looking harder and harder, i just couldn't find them... andI don't just mean inside the game.

The idea seemed to be utilize surealism to be a kafkaesque non-sequiter but not alegorical as kafka himself did. The reflection puzzles were a little rough in having to jump to the correct term with no primer; while the number puzzles were overly easy but had seemingly no significance as to why the numbers were chosen. And I am sorry; using in game oration to explain there is no rhyme or reason does not forgive such tie in/continuity issues.  Had the planetary model been something significant... like the actual alignment from his birth, or a famous date, or the location of the ""Kafka"" (3412) asteroid rather than the ""America"" asteroid it may have made some sence and been redeeming.    

For the most part this game was a string of somewhat properly translated dialogs very superficially skirting deeper philosophical ideals of clandestine intent and nihilist purpose; blocked by very easy puzzles that change in difficulty based on their involvement with the story; the more integrated ones are absolutely a breaze, while the ones that apparently no rhyme nor reason are absolutely murder.  

This can be seen when completing the erudite achievement.  some hints are absolutely obvious, vague to the point wondering why even bother, while the harder ones, just plain give you the answer because there is aparently no logical hint to be had.

To cut short; had this game been longer, had this game delved into the philosophical underpinnings that it started to (even if they were not inline with most of Kafka's own intents), or had this game had contnuity with puzzles and they have been more enjoyable/challenging I could in good faith recomend this game.  But as it stands it is a cute aesthetic of a game, that was made around a handful of somewhat amusing puzzles, trying to tie them in together with a very rudimentary (if not just wikipedia'd) knowledge of passing Kafka trivium, of which seems to only have been used because of the idea of his work was thought to be sureal for sureality's sake rather than a deeply disturbed alienation it was meant to convey originally. It was frustrating, and i am not sad i threw down a couple bucks, but I am kind of embarased I did so just to fulfil some idea of intelectual stimulation rather than looking at a lets play or something of the sort before hand and realizing this was not the droid i was looking for. I guess it is kind of like having a book on your shelf of an author you have not read, and probably won't read, purely to impress someone who may come over and see it who would extrapolate ideas of who you are based on a ... well, not actually lie.

- the price on sale is super low so i guess it was kind of worth it(?)

- achievements are easy to get (my 4 hours gameplay was me not paying attention to which 'level' had puzzles so i missed one at a level that wasn't supposed to have a puzzle due to its slow cutscene...) if you follow a guide (tbh, you REALLY NEED IT. bless this person's soul for spending 16 hours to create a complete guide of the whole game!)

the cons in this game include:

- what do these puzzles mean? how do you even solve them logically? i had to follow a walkthrough 24/7 because there were 0 explanations. literally nothing.

- what is the story even about? franz kafka is known to fuse realism and fantasy but this whole game is a mix of confusion and frustration, far away from what franz kafka stands for.

- when you finish a playthrough, you have to long-press that arrow button to go back ALL THE WAY TO THE FIRST LEVEL. and it happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. i would've thought if i was at let's say, level 5 act 2 (just an example), i would've been 'saved' at that point after i exit but NO I AM TELEPORTED TO THE LAST LEVEL OF THE BONUS ACT. so i have to go back ALL OVER AGAIN TO FIND THE NEXT LEVEL.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Considering the publishers of this game, Daedalic, of whom I've really liked a lot of games they've released, I expected an at least decent point-and-click experience. Perhaps I'd learn a few things of Kafka as well, whose works I'm only surface-level familiar with but still somewhat interested.

The game starts out nice, the graphics are stylized and cute and the music is very pleasant. We start out in the abode of K, who performs hypnosis on a patient, in the form of a little puzzle the player must solve. Fun stuff. After that, your dog comes in with an invitation letter. In the form of a little puzzle that the player must solve. Fun stuff. And so, K sets out into town on a walk, to visit this location he's been invited to.

... In the form of a little puzzle that the player must solve.

This is how the game goes from start to finish. Every single new transition scene is a new puzzle. Varying in difficulty, varying in intuitiveness, varying in relevance to the game. Every - single - new - scene. This makes the story trudge awfully slowly. Which would be... acceptable, if there was any actual story to speak of. After a little bit, K's world takes a turn into surrealism. The whole concept of everything becomes nonsensical. He tries to figure things out, asking around, but eventually accepts himself that nothing makes sense, and we as the player are seemingly just left there together with him. Amidst all the constant, random puzzles. I am actually unashamed to say that somewhere in the middle of this thankfully short game I was consistently looking at a guide for any puzzles that were too far-fetched for me, since I'd basically just... lost interest, in the puzzle concept.

Not to further mention that there's a hint system to the puzzles, as well; I ignored it at first but retraced my steps after finishing the game once, because there was an achievement to get for using hints on every stage and my life simply doesn't have more meaning than 100%-completing games on Steam. And the hints have a timer. After starting the puzzle I need to wait two and a half minutes for the hint to show up, each and every time. Why? What was the point of this feature, all of a sudden?

And so the game ends and I'm absolutely none the wiser. I don't know what it was I just played, except for a collection of very randomized puzzles. The meaning of the story completely escapes me. I'm not saying I dislike randomness every now and then, it can be a good source of entertainment, but it feels like this game wanted to go philosophically deep on things and... it just didn't register with me. The whole thing felt pointless. Artistic, for sure, but pointless. Maybe It's just me, though. Maybe I'm missing something vital, maybe I need to be more familiar with the works of Kafka to more thoroughly appreciate what's going on here.

I don't regret it.  The game is beautiful, taking its inspiration from surrealistic art, and I had fun playing through the different scenes, some even making me laugh. The gameplay is similar to a Rusty Lake game, except there is no inventory.
You click on everything to see if it triggers something, and solve puzzles by moving/changing things around, and if you are really stuck there is an hint system to help you.
I am not much familiar with Kafka works, but I saw some references to the trial, the metamorphosis, the vulture... But I assume there must be many more in the game.

""Я не стараюсь копировать сюжеты романов и рассказов Кафки в игре. Для меня важно передать атмосферу и настроение, присущие всему творчеству писателя.
Кроме того, я использую работы Кафки для реализации собственных идей. Такой подход к адаптации, на мой взгляд, более действенный и интересный. Одним из ярких примеров такого метода я бы назвал «Сталкера» Андрея Тарковского. Когда от оригинала в фильме осталось менее 10%"".

Трудно не согласиться: экранизация, игроизация - все они неизбежно ведут к переделкам и интерпретациям, где главный - вовсе не автор изначального произведения, а кинорежиссёр или геймдиректор.

Но эта игра не несёт в себе ни атмосферы, ни настроения Кафки. Кафкианский абсурд - это абсурд очень конкретный, социальный, экзистенциальный, неизбежный, подавляющий, вездесущий. От него не сосёт под ложечкой, от него не болят зубы, он не оставляет пространства для внутреннего манёвра. От абсурда Кафки идут бросаться с мостов.

It is an original puzzle/adventure game inspired by the writings of Franz Kafka. But unfortunately, the story has very little to do with Kafka, except that the protagonist of the story, named simply K. is involved in events that are beyond his own control and tries to find the way out of it (kind of, there are no clear motives for what he's doing), which is somewhat Kafkaesque, I must admit.

The art style is well-done and nice. Although is nothing surprisingly spectacular, is queer enough to allow characters like K. to seamlessly inhabit the same world as the Duck or Insect Detective without being too jarring. I also genuinely enjoy a lot of the music the game has to offer, even if the loops are relatively short. It manages to generate the correct theme and feeling the game clearly want the players to feel.

More like an ""experience"" than a real game, its length [i](~2 hours of gameplay)[/i] and simplicity [i](most of these puzzles can be solved simply by clicking and dragging things around, even if they are so confusing to understand what you were supposed to do)[/i] will prevent it from staying in your memories for long. A real shame, because this game has a potential, Denis Galanin [i](the solo developer)[/i] should have exploited way beyond, even if he had to increase the overall price a little bit.

It is pointless to try and describe the story as it is pretty incoherent. Though there is some charm to it with all this absurd going on. The fans will probably like it, because it has a lot of references to novels. 

Moving on to the most important for the puzzle game, the gameplay. It has a great variety of puzzles, some try your logic, some require out-of-the-box thinking and some are very simple and solved by clicking every object in the scene. If you get stuck, the game has a hint system. The hints can be obtained only after being stuck for 3 minutes. The hints do a good job of pointing you to the right solution. And after 2 more minutes, you get a second hint, that usually spoils the puzzle completely. 

Graphically the game looks gorgeous, but the animations are very simple. Each scene has a lot of small details and references not only to the writings of Kafka, but to pop culture in general. The soundtrack is good, it doesn't get on your nerves, but doesn't have anything memorable.

https://youtu.be/XGQujAVnwk8

There is a loose storyline here, but you don't realise there is one until the end. It's a series of single-screen scenes that start off with some speech-bubble dialog followed by clicking stuff to solve a puzzle, of which there are a good variety. Some you can use logic to solve, others trial/error/repetition, others benefit from simply clicking around the screen until something happens. After each few levels there are screens with bits of storyline and artwork without any puzzle, I guess you'd call them intervals. That's all there is to it really, it's a straightforward game with very little to explain.

There's not much in the way of options menu, it looks like a mobile game. You can switch from window to fullscreen (goes to full 1920x1200), toggle sound (no volume control) and there's a nice marquee-style level overview with pictures scrolling past. You can replay from any point.

[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]

The scenes are strange and imaginative, with Monty Pythonesque puzzle animations. It's not sophisticated but interesting to look at, nonetheless. Music and sound effects are sparse, but again, enjoyable when they do appear.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

There are a few very easy puzzles but most are easy/medium difficulty. There's a 3-stage hint system, each increasingly-obvious hint appears after a 3 minute countdown so you won't have any trouble progressing. There's no general timer for the levels, it's a casual game.

[h1]Value[/h1]

I often see Steam reviewers complaining that a game is too short and I think to myself ""that's a bit harsh, there's enough to satisfy"", but in this case I have to put my foot down. There are 20 or so levels that I'm sure could be speed-run in well under 30 minutes. There's no replay value once you know the solutions, unless you want to be a stickler and get the final achievement, as there will always be one missing - complete with all hints or complete with none. It's a shame because this silly price spoils my otherwise whole-hearted recommendation.

12 achievements, all easy to get apart from the last one (see above). 6 trading cards, Windows-only and no Steam Cloud.

The puzzles are fun and I enjoyed the surreal scenes and artwork, but it's over before you know it. The price is outrageous. I would certainly recommend it in a sale though.

Wer behauptet, es gebe keine Verbindung zwischen diesem Spiel und Frank Kafkas Schaffen: Genau wie die Protagonisten seiner Werke steht der Spieler in einer irgendwie unklaren Welt, wird mit der Geschichte eines Menschen konfrontiert und steht vor mehr Fragen als Antworten. Das bizarre Comic-Design verstärkt die außergewöhnliche Wirkung auf mich als Spieler. Die Bild- bzw. Mechanik-Rätsel sind zunächst und manche auch im Nachhinein schwer verständlich. Die meisten sind intuitiv nicht lösbar. Das Aufrufen der ""Hints"" gehört anders als bei klassischen Wimmelbildspielchen irgendwie dazu. Aber hier geht es vermutlich nicht darum, sich etwas zu beweisen - bspw. außerordentliche Cleverness. Vielleicht ist es eher eine Reise nach innen. Es geht um Bewusstsein. Um Wahrnehmung. Um die Absurdität unserer Welt. Um die Frage unseres Daseins. Traditionell werden solche Themen eher in Theaterstücken, Büchern und Filmen verarbeitet. Inzwischen gibt es sie auch in der Gestalt eines Computerspiels. Warum nicht?

Die Frage, ob das nun unter dem Strich gelungen ist, will ich mal so beantworten: Ich habe die zwei Stunden mit diesem Spiel sehr genossen. Es war für mich das Geld wert. Ich sehe auch sehr viel künstlerisches und kulturelles Potenzial für weitere Spiele dieser Art. Aber ich glaube, im monetären Sinne reich werden die Entwickler damit wohl nicht. Aber es würde die Gaming-Welt bereichern.",203,german

heute möchte ich mal über das Spiel Franz Kafka berichten. Es ist, vorweg genommen, ein Rätselspiel, welches euch auf eine Reise in die Vergangenheit führt und mitunter witzige Elemente beeinhaltet. Ich kann es für Rätselfans nur empfehlen, jedoch solltet ihr auch ein wenig des englischen mächtig sein, da teilweise Wörter (ich habe nur den ersten Akt halb bisher gespielt!) auf Englisch auftauchen, auf die man so, als ausschließlich deutschsprachiger Spieler, nicht gekommen wäre. 

Was mir leider zu diesem bisher wirklich tollen Spiel negativ aufgefallen ist, als ich es oben links auf das X zum beenden geklickt habe, ist mir das Spiel eingefroren und danach abgestürzt. Bitte noch nachpatchen liebes Daedalic Entertainment Studio, welches dieses sicher großartige Spiel veröffentlicht hat.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Ich habe in anderen Rezensionen mehrfach gelesen, dass das Spiel außer seinem Namen nichts mit Franz Kafka zu tun habe. Ich würde dieser Aussage widersprechen wollen. Der Stil und die Aufmachung sind surreal und viele Ereignisse scheinen nur wenig Sinn zu ergeben - aber genau das spiegelt sich auch häufig in Parabeln Kafkas wider. Ich glaube, dass jeder der einiges von Kafka gelesen hat, seinen Spaß damit haben kann, denn es sind zahlreiche Anspielungen im Spiel vorhanden. Ich zähle einfach mal jene auf, die mir sofort aufgefallen sind, vermutlich finden sich noch einige mehr: Sein unvollendeter Romane ""Der Verschollene"" (zuvor unter ""Amerika"" veröffentlicht), daraus das Kapitel ""Der Heizer"", der Roman ""Die Verwandlung"" und die Parabel ""Vor dem Gesetz"", seine erste Verlobte Felice Bauer.

Natürlich fehlt der Darstellung vielleicht ein wenig das Düstere, Bedrohliche und Schwere, das Kafkas Erzählungen oftmals innewohnt (eben das wortwörtlich kafkaeske). Tatsächlich erinnern die Zeichnungen und Szenen einen manchmal eher an die Bilder von Salvadore Dali. Ich sehe darin aber kein Problem, denn surreal bleibt das Ganze ja dennoch. 

Wenn jetzt irgendwer ein dickes Adventure erwartet, dass auf einer Kafka-Biographie oder einem seinem Romane beruht,  der wird natürlich enttäuscht. Aber wie sage ich meinen Schülern so gern: Wer lesen kann ist klar im Vorteil. Die Beschreibung zum Spiel ist relativ eindeutig: ""Kein Inventar. Keine Bosskämpfe. Keine RPG Elemente. Nur Skurrilität und Surrealismus."" Insofern hatte ich auch keine großen Erwartungen und habe es im Sale gekauft. Das zweistündige Rätseln hat mir am Ende jedenfalls Spaß gemacht, ich habe mich um meine Zeit nicht betrogen gesehen.

If I had paid full price, I would have immediately considered a refund.
• Filled with mostly awful puzzles.
 Granted, I expected absurdities in a Kafka game.  I did not expect obtuse, un-fun clicking.  Includes the classic ""15 puzzle""--which is as annoying as that other old chestnut, The Towers of Hanoi... Not a difficult puzzle, just especially tedious.  Only one puzzle evoked a sense of adventure game accomplishment, as I could recognize the logic behind it.
• Beautifully illustrated.
 Pleasant graphics are the only quality I would consider above average.
• A mobile-quality app at best, priced well above its value.

The Franz Kafka Videogame is a point and click puzzle game that is inspired by the writings of Franz Kafka, but is not directly based off of any of them. Practically the only thing that I enjoyed about the game was the the artwork, which I think is cute and very well done. The rest of the game is either uninspired or poor.

The music and sound didn't really stand out to me at all, other than not caring for the credits music. The story was not really interesting, which is a real let down. If you're going to make a game about a famous writer, I feel like the writing should be top notch; instead, the writing in this game is bland, and the story never goes anywhere interesting. 

The puzzles themselves were not enjoyable. I felt like a lot of them were so surreal and bizarre that it was incredibly difficult to solve them without the use of hints, but not in a good way; There is practically no logic to some of the puzzles, causing it to feel like pixel hunting at times.

Ultimately, the game feels like a very short, half baked Professor Layton game without the fun narrative and puzzles, and as such, I can't really recommend it.",202,english

Kafka is one of the greatest writers in History, but its work isn't for everybody. You love Kafka or you hate Kafka. This game is just brilliant but probably not too interesting who are not familiar with Kafka or who doesnt like Kafka. The art is just beautiful, music is beautiful, puzzles have lots of Kafka references (For example in Act 1, when its dark there is a clear bug shadow which is referance to metamorphisis, also the tables you have, also the background has maze like buildings which is a clear referance to the courtrooms in Le Process) and they are in a way o Kafka stories and the story line is existentialist as Kafka stories are.

You can't just throw in randomness by creating unlogical puzzles because you are either too lazy or not qualified enough to build a decent puzzle game and make up for that by calling it absurd or kafkaesque.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Thr Franz Kafka Videogame je velmi krátká adventura (cca hodina a půl), která se spíše volně inspirovala dílem Franze Kafky. Od Kafky jsem už přečetla Proměnu, Zámek a Proces, ale rozhodně nepatří k mým oblíbeným autorům. Jisté narážky jsem tedy zachytila, ale s ohledem na název toho opravdu mohlo být víc. Autor se snažil především zachytit atmosféru kafkovských děl, jistou zoufalost a bezmocnost, kterou sice hlavní hrdina možná cítí, ale já se s ním neměla jak ztotožnit a bylo mi to celkem jedno. 
Autorovi nelze upřít kreativitu, hra obsahuje velké množství hádanek a v podstatě nenarazíte na dvě stejné, to se mi hodně líbilo. Ale kromě toho hra nenabízí nic nového a inspirace Kafkou není tak výrazná, aby opravdu zaujala, bojím se, že za pár dní si na hru ani nevzpomenu. 

Pokud máte rádi adventury a hádanky, rozhodně tuhle hru zkuste, ale spíše počkejte, až bude ve slevě.

Klar, die Puzzles sollen kaftkaesque und surreal wirken, wenn diese jedoch keiner nachvollziehbaren Logik folgen nimmt das enorm die Motivation. Vielleicht sind die Rätsel auch einfach zu schierig.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"В данном обзоре я расскажу вам об игре The Franz Kafka Videogame. От разработчика Denis Galanin (mif2000).  Обзор не содержит плагиата и написан целиком и полностью мной, Гвардом.

Предыстория, сюжет:Действие игры происходит примерно в той же книжной вселенной что и действие произведений Кафки по мотивам которых и была создана данная игра. Нам предстоит сыграть за бедного врача психотерапевта по имени К мечтающего добыть немного денег и сыграть таки наконец то свадьбу со своей любимой. Благо, судьба подкинула нам такую возможность...


Геймплей: Игра The Franz Kafka Videogame по жанру относится к адвенчурам и квестам с примесью головоломок. Как и все произведения Франца Кафки сюжет данной игры да и сама игра в целом это своеобразный театр абсурда и хаоса. После старта игры нам показывают небольшую заставку в которой рассказывают о непростой судьбе нашего героя. Зовут его мистер К. После чего мы видим и самого главного героя который принимает первую пациентку, страдающую от ночных кошмаров. Вид в игре с боку, причем стиль графики подобран весьма необычно, фигуры персонажей словно бы вырезаны из картона. В то время как все декорации включая задники выглядят нарисованными. Наш доктор мозгоправ применяет методику гипноза что бы помочь пациентке. Причем в мир гипноза и кошмаров мы попадем еще не раз... Он достает часы на цепочке и начинает гипнотизировать даму ну а мы кликаем мышкой по часам и попадаем в голову к этой самой даме. Теперь наша цель — избавить её от кошмаров, сама же дама у нас предстает в виде маленькой девочки.

Собственно здесь нас ожидает наша первая головоломка в игре. Нужно найти кролика для девочки. Мы можем щелкать курсором мыши по предметам на экране проверяя нет ли где кролика. За одно получая забавные или порой тревожные эффекты вроде вылетающего из коробки гуманоидного одноглазого существа с кроличьими ушами и говорящего с нами на латыни. Мда, черте-что в головах у людей творится. Кстати интерфейса игрового как такового нет если не принимать во внимание книжки подсказок вверху справа и настроек игры сверху слева. Проведя небольшие манипуляции с фонариком девочки и декорациями в виде солнышка и облака, а так же шаром — мы в итоге найдем таки своего кхм...кролика. Пусть и не совсем уж обычного. Уже первая загадка головоломка дает нам понять что все прочие головоломки в игре будут еще более сложные и иметь не всегда очевидное решение. Наконец то наша пациентка избавлена от кошмаров и уходит.А к нам заявляется весьма необычный посетитель — милый пёсик с письмом в пасти. Впрочем, даже письмо просто так прочитать нам не дадут — оно так же является пазлом-головоломкой который надо решить. Причем еще в и виде Qr кода. В 1924 году,угу...Впрочем, нам не код собрать надо на самом деле, а правильно составить лабиринт от левой части со стрелкой до правой с крестиком. Вообще складывается впечатление что в игре не столько сюжета сколько постоянного решения тех или иных загадок и головоломок. Это поставлено во главу угла геймплея в данной игре.

Далее прочитав приглашение в письме нам нужно добраться до места встречи. Мы выходим наружу из дома и тут нас ждет аналог настольной игры где мы бросаем кубик что бы по количеству выпавших очков двигаться по клеткам. Игра не перестаёт нас удивлять. Фигурка шахматного коня будет создавать нам препятствия так что сразу до места не добраться. Не забываем прощелкивать окрестные постройки и предметы — это поможет нам решить очередную головоломку.  Вообще небольшим минусом игры является то что часть головоломок является абсолютно не логичной и не очевидной по решениям. И если мы не знаем что делать дальше то просто методично начинаем прощупывать курсором все возможные объекты на экране и в итоге получаем решение. Конечно это немного в стиле Кафки, но со временем надоедает. Хочется самому находить правильное решение, а не методом перебора. Ну откуда можно знать заранее что если кликнуть по гаражу нарисованного домика — от туда выедет машинка из игры Монополия и только после этого бросок кубика приведет к решению головоломки? С другой стороны, сильным моментом геймплея игры является то что все головоломки абсолютно различны как по виду так и по методике решения. Да, они причудливы и порой непонятны даже с десятого раза, но они всегда очень разные. Правда лично у меня после часа игры — стала реально побаливать голова от творящегося на экране безумного сюрреализма. Понравиться данная игра может только поклонникам творчества Кафки или очень большим любителям сложных неочевидных головоломок. Я вас предупредил...


Графика:Графика в игре пусть и не блещет красотами и красками, но имеет свой уникальный графический стиль. Да и анимация какая-никакая и у персонажей и у декораций имеется. К тому же игра нарочито выдержана в таком стиле и таком графическом оформлении что придает её дополнительный шарм.
Музыка и звук:Музыка в игре отличная, расслабляющая и подходящая под геймплей.

The story does not really focus around Kafka, it starts in the middle of somewhere and then picks out some pieces of his life which are told in a soberingly boring way. I really did't get neither the connections between the scenes or circumstances in general. 

The puzzles could be good if they were somehow a little bit more connected to the plot, other than that I had to guess a lot to figure them out (until I quit the game because it got too boring and confusing for me). 
If you're looking for an atmospheric puzzle game with an inspiring story go elsewhere.

It's just puzzles. Not in a point and click way, not even in a hidden objects kind of way, but very much in a ""pray we didn't put in a Rubik's cube"" early 2000's flash games kind of way. Throwback to newgrounds simulator. You've seen these before, it's just that this time around they're all in the same game. Neat.
It's not about Kafka. Kafka is in it, the game references a lot of Kafka's writings, but as a vague aesthetic rather than a commentary or critique of Kafka's themes. This is the Lovecraft game of Kafka games if you will. The most Kafkaesque thing about this game is that when you subject yourself to it - Kafka becomes you a little bit (but not in a clever way).

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"Kafka bietet in Werk und Person genug Möglichkeiten, um daraus weitere spannende Geschichten weben zu können. Steven Soderberghs Film ""Kafka"" ist dafür ein Beispiel, das sich nicht von der Hand weisen lässt oder auch Robert Crumbs Comic, der sich mit Kafka befasst. Warum sollte es also nicht auch ein Videospiel zu Kafka geben? Es gibt keinen Grund, weshalb dem nicht so sein sollte. Das Problem liegt darin, dass dieses Spiel mit Kafka im eigentlichen Sinne nichts zu tun hat. Es gibt lose Anspielungen auf seine Biographie und seine Geschichten. Oftmals werden diese Anteile an dem Spiel so verdreht, dass sie nur noch dem Namen nach mit Kafka in Bezug zu setzen sind. Überhaupt erklärt sich nicht, inwiefern sich Kafka und sein Werk dafür eigenen, in simplen Minispielen rezipiert zu werden. Eine atmosphärische Visual Novel wäre selbsterklärend sinnvoll dafür, aber Minispiele sind es nicht. Doch bei der Entwicklung hat wohl niemand Ansprüche an sich selbst formuliert, getreu dem Motto, dass der Name Kafka schon für Qualität bürgen wird. Es ist schade, wenn sich derart missbräuchlich an großer Literatur bedient wird. Ein Fehlschlag kommt immer mal vor. Das ist verzeihlich, wenn sich mit wirklichen Größen gemessen wird. Doch hier ist der Name nur der Aufhänger, um Käufer in die Falle zu locken. 
Neben dem unseriösen Umgang mit Kafka bleibt der Umstand, dass das Spiel an sich nicht gut ist. Die Graphik vermittelt keinerlei Stimmung. Für ein Spiel für Kinder wäre sie vielleicht passend, aber nicht für ein Spiel, das Kafka als Kontext heranzieht, obwohl die Rätsel tatsächlich auf Kinderniveau sind. Viel Spaß lässt sich mit den Rätseln nicht haben. Zu einfach, zu öde, wenn Versuch und Irrtum schneller zum Ziel führen, als nachzudenken. Sollte es doch einmal mehr als zwei Minuten dauern ein Rätsel zu lösen, kann man sich vom Spiel selbst die Lösung holen. Was sich nun auch nicht im Geringsten erklärt, sind die Massen an popkulturellen Anspielungen. Sie ergeben keinen Sinn. Eine Referenz an die Looney Tunes sprich Bugs Bunny in dieses Spiel einzubauen ist dann auch schon ein Element, mit dem sich konkret über Kafka lustig gemacht wird. Den Machern bedeutet das Werk, auf das sie sich beziehen offenbar nichts, sonst hätten sie die Würde gehabt, dieses Spiel nicht zu machen. Es ist schade, wenn der Name eines Toten dazu degradiert wird, nur für ein paar Euro mehr an Einnahmen herhalten zu müssen, um ein schlechtes Spiel besser verkaufen zu können.",155,german

Unfortunately there's very little puzzle, game, or plot to be found here. The most ""intuitive"" puzzle was a 3x3 sliding block puzzle which I solved, only to discover that it actually wants you to turn off the lights and solve an unrelated image, and the lights turn back on every time you move a piece. 

Some other puzzles boil down to counting moving objects, clicking random things until it works (usually having to start over if anything is wrong), intuiting that something is meant to be upside-down without any cues, and a mandatory intermission so you can stare at a blank screen while a full song plays and a bit longer just for fun. Don't go to the menu during that intermission or it will start over.

Maybe the incoherent plot is purposeful and meant to be artsy, but it ends up making a short game feel long and dragged out. I'm guessing most of the plot is vague Kafka references, but It's hard to care whats happening when there's barely even dream logic connecting events, especially when there's barely anything related to the puzzles themselves.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"There are little flashes of brilliance in The Franz Kafka Videogame, but my overwhelming sense is that its creator doesn't have a strong understanding of Franz Kafka, and his grasp on good game design is even weaker. Puzzles are arbitrary and derivative, with so little audio/visual feedback that it can be difficult to tell if clicking through the screens has any effect at all.

Kafka left behind numerous works that illustrated a clear and specific point of view regarding topics like bureaucracy, work, and depression. The Franz Kafka Videogame mostly ignores its namesake, instead settling for the aesthetic of surrealism—the aesthetic; not the deeper artistic meaning. It takes as much from Merry Melodies, Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, and Twin Peaks as it does from Kafka's own oeuvre.

The result is a game that does, indeed, look lovely. In fact, I might be less harsh if the title had been ""A Series of Logic Puzzles With Cute, Surrealism-Inspired Drawings,"" but alas, most of the puzzles are pretty lousy.  On multiple occasions, I solved puzzles before I knew what I was meant to be solving. Sometimes, I just clicked everywhere until something happened. There are maybe 3-5 different ""puzzles"" where you're presented with two or three equal options (e.g., left or right, or fish, flower, or fox). Select the correct one, and you're given two or three more options. Get one wrong, go back to the start. Continue until you reach the end. Fun!

[b]What this game is:[/b] An adventure game of sorts with puzzles, and an absurd bent.

[b]How does it work?:[/b] You start as a young hypnotist that is looking for a way to make a living.  You receive your first patient, and are launched into an oneiric story where you do not know what reality is anymore.  Solve various puzzles that have to be solved in order to get to the bottom of the story.  Nothing more can be said without spoiling the rest...

[b]How does it perform?:[/b]The game works without bugs, has good ambient music, a delightfully disorienting story, with very nice visuals.  It starts providing hints after three minutes, which you may decide to ignore in order to make the game more challenging.  You can get a maximum of two hints, but here is a warning: the second hints is often the solution to the puzzle, so if you really want some entertainment in solving the puzzle, try not to look at it.  

[b]The good points:[/b] a nice ambiance, good music, interesting puzzles (if you don't use the hints - and have to figure it all by yourself).  Takes limited space on your HD (close to 190 Mb).  

[b]The bad points:[/b] none important except one thing.  There seems to be a problem with the McAfee software protection suite.  The executable file of Franz Kafka Videogame is seen as a threat by McAfee and it will automatically take steps to isolate it and offer you to delete it...  The problem was signalled three years ago to McAfee, but nothing seems to have been made on this side.  I do not know what the publishers of the game have done on their side, no information is available in regard to any representation they might have made with McAfee.  So, if you buy this game and have McAfee acting out, there do not seem to be any problem with it when you play it, but you need to exclude the executable file from McAfee scans in order to be able to play.  You can find the solution in the discussions for this game in Steam.

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"I'm giving this the thumbs up from the delightful styling, music and quirky story. Not having read any Kafka and only aware he has Surrealist elements in his works, I can't comment how well his vibe permeates through this game. From a laymans' perspective I found this games' puzzles very infuriating although after discovering how it's done I can appreciate the out-of-the-box quality of some of them. A few I managed to stumble through and there's a conventional puzzle with a twist but just an advance hint that you have to think absurd and can't rely on viewing things as they're given. I think the most frustrating thing sometimes is that the clues are just as perplexing as the puzzle and had to watch a walkthru for the watch puzzle but I was very close if I had noticed the odd thing out a little longer. Otherwise the positives are the music and surrealism is whimsical but they really need a volume control on the sound or the sound can be vexing. Kudos to the music and graphics people but the hint and puzzle part of the team need some fine tuning. Thought the game broke halfway through but don't panic it's not a bug. lol Long story short I'm glad I played it but wouldn't play it again to get the remaining locked achievements since the first run thru was so unsatisfying. It gets just a passing grade in view of the bargain price I bought it at. hehe Might be fun to play with a partner or friend with some liquid fortitude in hand to dull the annoyance. :P",179,english

0,steam_reviews/392280_TheFranzKafkaVideogame.json,709,217,"[h1]Story[/h1]
This is a story of K., a psychotherapist specialized in the treatment of phobias and depressions. In order to marry his fiancée Felice he needs to earn more money. One day a company, Castlock Corp. from America, sent a message that he is accepted to a job that he did not even apply for. Nevertheless, K. has no other choice. This game is a voyage towards K.'s subconscious. The story is not based on Kafka's writings but the naming of the characters and the flow of events seem to be inspired by his way of thinking.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game consist of four acts and each act contains several scenes. Puzzles are solved in one window. Some puzzles are really difficult. There is a hint button on the upper right end of the screen. The first hint becomes visible after 3 minutes and the second one after 2. There are some far-fetched puzzles where you rampantly click each pixel to find the answer and there are some cleverly designed ones. Nonetheless, the game is short.

[h1]Evaluation[/h1]
The art and music of the game are pretty solid. The title of the game is probably given for the marketing and the inspiration; yet, I think Kafka's name can be used in the subtitle. The puzzles may be frustrating for some players. In addition to these, since this game is based on a surreal context, the storyline is neither coherent nor smooth. It is better to grab this game as a part of a bundle.

Per chi come me è a digiuno o non conosce le opere di Kafka, non potrebbe minimamente vedere i vari riferimenti nel gioco, vedrebbe solo un'avventura grafica surreale piena di enigmi. In ogni situazione c'e solo 1 enigma, non ci sono oggetti da raccogliere o altro. Alcuni enigmi sono lievemente difficili. Per questi enigmi, ci viene in aiuto il taccuino dei suggerimenti, che funziona a tempo. Dopo i primi 3 minuti dall'inizio dell'enigma, il taccuino ci da un suggerimento piu o meno vago. Ma solo dopo 2 minuti dal primo suggerimento, ecco apparire il secondo suggerimento. In cui la maggiorparte delle volte è la soluzione all'enigma stesso. Ma ci sono casi in cui anche con entrambi i suggerimenti non si capisce la soluzione come ad esempio: Nell'enigma del permesso. Questo titolo lo consiglio solo agli amanti dell'autore, gli altri passino pure oltre. A meno che, non lo troviate a meno di 1 euro e volete un'avventura surreale.

Ich bin nicht der größte Kafka-Experte, habe aber schon einiges von ihm gelesen (darunter auch: Die Verwandlung) und muss sagen, dass mir Kafka, in seiner Art und Weise wie er Texte verfasst richtig gut gefällt.

Kafka hat seine ganz eigene Art Geschichten zu erzählen (""kafkaesk"") und wollte vorallem durch Verfremdung von Geschehnissen ein bestimmtes Gefühl des Nachdenkens beim Leser erzeugen.

Zum Spiel:

Es handelt sich um ein indi point and click adventure mit einem großen Fokus auf das Erzählte.
Man muss verschiedenste mehr oder weniger schwere Rätsel lösen, die vorallem sehr surreal gestalltet sind. 
Vom ersten Rätsel an ist klar, dass das Spiel den Spieler bei doch ganz logisch zu erscheinenden Dingen an der Nase herumführen will.

Der Fokus liegt auf der zwar kurzen, aber jedoch unkonventionellen Story und ist ehr als Experiment und Ausflug in den Surrealismus gedacht, als eine ernstzunehmende und emotional mitreißende Geschichte.

Meine Meinung:

Ich bin ein Fan von solchen Indie Spielen, die versuchen anderst zu sein und auch  neue Wege einschlagen zu wollen. Jedoch muss ich kritisieren, dass mir der kafkaeske-Faktor viel zu kurz kam und ich mir auch wirklich nachdenklich machende Stellen im Spiel gewünscht hätte.

0,steam_reviews/394360_HeartsofIronIV.json,232569,10,"I want to love this game. Most everything about it appeals to me, EXCEPT for 3 main issues. One is VERY large, the other two are more minor. 

MAJOR ISSUE: Peace conferences. You can spend hours upon hours carefully crafting your new empire, shepherding it through discontent at home, the great depression, production problems, strikes, and every other thing under the sun. You can expand this empire across large swaths of the world, extending your benevolent hegemony to All The People. However when the war is finally over, the AI will promptly snatch it all away from you through some unknown, unfeeling, Kafka-esqe algorithms during the peace conferences which utterly destroys everything you just created. It almost literally pulls the rug out from under your feet, leaving your troops suddenly stranded in lands you had conquered. It is possibly the strongest feeling of anti-climactic letdown I have ever experienced in a game. It makes all your efforts for nothing. 

EXAMPLE: U.S. is not at war -> U.S. invades Mexico -> Mexico joins Allies after the fact -> U.S. predictably conquers Mexico -> U.S. now swiftly conquers Canada because it's part of the Allies and dared to attack the U.S. from the north -> the U.S. then doesn't join the larger war or any factions and just sits happy and independent in its new North American Empire -> ALL YOUR NEW TERRITORY IS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU WHEN A BUNCH OF EUROPEANS SIGN A TREATY ENDING THEIR WAR WHICH HAS NO RELEVANCE TO YOU AT ALL. Ridiculous.

Minor issue #1: As others have mentioned in other reviews, it is difficult to achieve much compliance in countries you have knocked over. This is apparently worse now than it used to be after their recent updates/DLCs? I couldn't really say since I've only played the game for a few weeks, but it is extremely annoying. Putting MP's in your units helps, but it's still not great.

Minor issue #2: The game effectively runs on only one processor thread. That's pretty lame even for a 2016 vintage game. Come on, guys. This leads to predictable and irritating game slow-down once your campaign has been running for a while and there is constantly lots of combat for it to chew through.",58156,english

that is the best description for this game. It has clearly the vibes of Silent Hill 2 or other games of the psychological horror genre. The kafkaesque style is not everyones taste but it is (for its length) a very well rounded story-driven game, with minor puzzles in it.

Pro:
1) The simple, but well grounded story
2) The different characters of the games and the meanings they have for the main character of this game
3) The Art-Sytle (Simple, but disturbing)
4) The Soundtrack
5) The sometimes real funny achievements

Contra:
1) The fact that any action you take has no real consequence
2) No replayability at all
3) The game-length for the price
4) The tad (obvious) message behind the story

Would I buy this game! Only in a sale. The game is fairly short and easy to complete under 2 hours. If the price is down to 2-3 €/$, but then you can give it a try. It is a well worth change from the usual AAA games. So give Jesse Makkonen a chance, you won`t regret it.",122,english

I won't go into the corporate shitstorm behind this shame of a game.  Just the beginning is enough to let you know it is soulless.

I keep playing Arcania, trying to love this game. It worked with Two Worlds 1 & 2 - i somehow loved those games as i played.

Yet Arcania somehow manages to feel ...offensive. And here's why:

The total abandonment of the series tone and color has happened before in other games - but here the lack of care about anything is, like, RUDE. Storyline and undertone are not merely uninteresting. they kinda feel generic IN YOUR FACE. Like, sadistically. Instead of atmosphere, intrigue and corruption you get unintroduced linear fetch quests with zero reasons to care about them. The characteristic smell of moneygrab  is all over, ''we don't care about your games sucker$$$''.

Thankfully the spirit of GOTHIC lives on in the RISEN series.

When Leopardi wrote his poems, he was searching for something, for a sense of *more*, for a meaning, for, in a word, transcendence -- that finds expression in every sentence, nay, every word and sentence of this masterpiece: right down to the vowels. The only way to transcendence -- is this game.

When Nietzsche developed his philosophy he wanted to escape from the assumptions and misconceptions of European society and culture, to become truly a self; to date the only work of art that would assist one in becoming an Ubermensch - to be become *what one is*-- is this game. 

When Sartre wrote his No Exit and Nausea, he was trying to express the strange incoherence of existence that lies behind our built-up beliefs and behaviours, to show how Radical Freedom is the fact of our lives. The only path one can walk to fulfill your potential to be a self, to truly exist,  -- is this game.

When Pessoa wrote his ""factless autobiography"" he was trying to express the inexpressible tedium of life, to express through paradox the fact that even the idea of paradox is a paradox; for individuality is the containing of paradoxes in our selves, yet to nothing, for tedium continues to crush us. But the only way to escape the pain of living -- is this game. 

When Kafka wrote his Trial and Metamorphosis he was able to show the absurdity of human relationships, the fragility of so-called love, and justice and law: but the only thing that can truly express these truths: -- is this game. 

When Cioran wrote about his times at the peaks of despair, about his bottomless white nights of insommia, he was trying to show the ""irrational nature of existence which continues itself without reason"": but the only work of art that can show this to us, so far: -- is this game. 

And, when each of us stops for just a moment, as we wake up and cringe ourselves out of our beds and anticipate the disasters, misery and shame that the day will bring us; what are we looking for? The beauty of yuri is the only thing that justifies life, for in reading yuri we lose everything to the purity and gain nothing... -- for what is there to be gained from the world? Nothing. The world is material for our intrepretation of the world, but all of these intrepretations, being personal, are meaningless. Therefore only yuri allows us to express our radical freedom, to survive our white nights, to give solidity to our love, and our society, to allow our paradoxes to form a beautiful whole, to find transcendence, to become what we are: the only way to survive the world we live in -- is yuri.",144,english

the most interesting thing of this game is its capacity to be analysed: it is a demonstration of the downfalls of capitalism while being a propagandist advertisement for the system. Understanding this irony gives bounties more enjoyment than actually playing.

It pulls the amazing feat of copying Monopoly, dodging copyright law by removing every aspect of the game remotely enjoyable. The game begins at the period of the game you may recall as the part of Monopoly where the goal shifts from winning to just being able to leave. The inability to barter and mortgage removes all the complexity (and evaporates any feeling of humanity from within the 'game'. Monopoly, as much as it is infuriatingly luck-based, disappears in the shadow of the role of luck in this horrid nightmare.

0,steam_reviews/4000_GarrysMod.json,958445,2,"Amazing game, but remember, it's only as good as the addons you put into it. The very basic singleplayer itself is fun, but lacking in parts as a sandbox game. However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.

0,steam_reviews/400_Portal.json,131540,3,"When I was in high school over ten years ago, most of my peers played shooter games, perhaps my least favourite of genres next to E.A. Sports, and I was hard-pressed to imagine, ample though my imagination might have been, that a puzzle game, some relic of my childhood, might become as popular as Half-Life 2. Of course, I was in good company regarding intellectual gaming; most of my friends were either in Marching Band, Robotics or Debate. I can’t remember when first I heard the GLaDOS theme song, since I only recall it as a staple of the “nerd culture” from that surreal time spent with the adolescent engineers. When first I heard a trashy Latin brass version of the familiar hook as the opening theme to Portal, I recognized it near-instantly. The lore was known to me, and I secretly pined for the conviction that Portal was truly MY kind of game; puzzle gamers are often marginalized. It took me over a decade to get around to downloading it, and even having installed it I took almost eight days to get around to playing it, perhaps for fear of being disappointed. I was not. I saw the cult classic for what it was: an edgy three-D puzzle platformer which begins in benign, sterile but ominous settings and descends into nightmarish complexity. Many elements of the story were already common knowledge to my mind, so I was playing for gameplay and effect. The puzzles were presented along a masterfully executed learning curve. It struck me quickly as the sort of game that one can enter at almost any level of proficiency in puzzle gaming, granted that one is familiar with the control scheme which made Half-Life so popular. Inevitably, at some point or another no amount of background experience can account for the novelty of each subsequent level, yet this creates not only a sense of immersion in the peculiarities of the World but also a sense of continuity throughout the game, as each of the preceding levels is recognized as a fundamental building block in one’s progress through this Kafkaesque, labyrinthine laboratory, appreciated both as an encouraging achievement and as a helpful hint for what’s to come. Anxiety and existential despair creep in quickly as the condescending voice of the tutorial instructor gets more and more reminiscent of the sociopaths that one meets regrettably in life. This renders the game’s final moments not only captivating and addicting, but tremendously satisfying, so that any typical cliché science fiction paranoia becomes less about the author and more about the player; I feel for the victims of this terrible contraption, while also venerating the fallen heroes who helped elucidate my path. I should also note that, for the first time in my life, I understand the appeal of that dreadful knockoff The Stanley Parable: gamers apparently enjoyed Stanley as an homage, but great satire does not need to be satirized in turn. Portal is everything I wanted it to be. I finished it in practically one sitting, taking breaks only to use the restroom and to walk the dog, though I was already on (what I believed to be) the later levels by the first time that I left the room. It took me five hours, and those were five hours well spent. I got to see how a game could at once captivate my fellow point-and-click puzzle gamers and engage the guys who hosted LAN parties and raved over shoot-em-ups. The setting is just dark enough to be mature, just ironic enough to be funny, and just mind-bending enough to arouse childlike wonder and curiosity, without ever becoming excessively so, supplying players with a healthy balance of complexity and simplicity, so that we feel at once impressed with ourselves for solving the problems but dazzled by the cinematic, almost cartoon brilliance of the solution. While the game made me feel a sense of embarrassing debt, since so many of my own design ideas as an indie game developer have their origin in Portal, simply funneled through the derivative character of games like The Stanley Parable, (one which I was motivated to redesign in my own ventures, intuiting its hidden potential) I was also reminded of the tremendous debt that Valve Itself owed to such classic works of art such as 2001: a Space Odyssey and the works of Kafka and Philip K. Dick. Portal is an example of an Art Game which succeeds as both Art AND Game, though one has perhaps to be both an Artist AND a Gamer to appreciate its full effect. When I finally reached the closing credits, though I’d watched them many times before, and many years ago at that, it was my first time watching them like this.

If you're looking for Lovecraft, Edgar Poe or Kafka-type unease, madness and horror, look no further than The Last Door. And play both seasons chronologically.

Season 2 seems to be a definite finale to the storyline that began in Season 1 (of course, with possible new games set in the same universe) and answers all the questions that needed answers, without ruining the unspeakbleness of horrors you encounter, leaving them still beyond your understanding. The story feels trailing off guidelessly at times, unlike Season 1, where it always felt like it was more bits of the same story. But it's still interesting, told in a great way that mixes story and puzzle bits without breaking the pace all that much. There are few moments where I felt that I was starting to wonder aimlessly not noticing a necessary item/dialogue trigger to move the game forward, but those moments were rare and didn't ruin the experience in any way. There were also several simple non-game-breaking bugs that will probably get fixed soon. With only big complaint remaining from the previous Season - that you can't really skip scenes if you're replaying the episode and want to find something you might've missed or just to re-experience specific moments.

0,steam_reviews/410430_Morphine.json,668,1,"[h1] Morphine: interessante idea, pessima realizzazione [/h1]

[i] Morphine [/i] è un indie horror che narra le vicende di Peter, un ragazzo emaciato, goffo e insicuro, che è perpetuamente bullizzato dai compagni di classe, in particolar modo da Ted, e mortificato tenacemente dalla famiglia. Tali ostinate umiliazioni sono il terreno fertile per intraprendere un viaggio psichedelico nella mente devastata di Peter. Questo percorso perturbante ha come principale protagonista un coniglio rosa antropomorfo, che ricorda terribilmente Frank, del film “Donnie Darko”, che, a differenza di quest’ultimo, ha un atteggiamento sadico e talvolta nonsense/comico, piuttosto che esistenzialista come nel film. 
La storia è abbastanza interessante ed è narrata in maniera quasi decente, tuttavia il comparto tecnico fa acqua da tutte le parti: bug e glitch ovunque e grafica non curata. Le mie aspettative non erano esagerate ed ero ben disposta a chiudere un occhio, visto il prezzo irrisorio. Il problema inizia a sorgere quando Morphine diviene ingiocabile e necessita di un restart, perché magari i comandi non rispondono, c’è un black screen, oppure sei catapultato in una realtà diversa da quella stabilita dal gioco e il protagonista non può muoversi in nessuna direzione. Insomma, diviene frustrante, persino per un gioco che hai pagato poche decine di centesimi. Nel complesso l’opera appare un prodotto rozzo, grezzo. L’idea alla base è particolarmente interessante, ma il lavoro complessivo è troppo raffazzonato: avrebbe potuto essere potenzialmente un’opera alla Egon Schiele, alla Franz Kafka, invece si riduce ad essere un giochino a tratti frustrante perché i comandi non rispondono, con una trama interessante ma non spiegata adeguatamente. Potenzialmente avrebbe potuto essere un profondo horror psicologico, concretamente non lo è. Concretamente vale i soldi per cui ho speso, ed è l’unica ragione per cui, nel bene e nel male, lo consiglio, anche se con riserva. Ci sono troppi buchi di trama, troppi errori, non solo tecnici, ma anche concettuali. Anzitutto, perché c’è scritto che è un FPS nella descrizione del gioco? Ma dove? Ma in quale galassia e in quale universo? Il gameplay è ridotto all’osso con i classici WASD per muoversi e giusto il tasto F per interagire con i pochissimi oggetti con cui si può interagire: definirlo minimale è poco. Il gioco è macchinoso, non fluido e si gioca con la paura che qualche errore di programmazione possa vanificarti la partita. Ma poi, vi sono errori grammaticali in inglese molto sciocchi e una confusione nei nomi non giustificabile. Sappiamo che Peter è il protagonista e Ted è l’antagonista; entrambi fanno molto cliché americano come aspetto estetico e modalità di interazione bullo/vittima, ma va bene. Verso la fine del gioco c’è uno switch dei nomi. Inizialmente si può pensare persino ad una svolta psichedelica, stile Far Cry 3 “you are me and I am you”, ma sarebbe stata una mossa troppo profonda per un gioco che è poco rifinito, incompleto e grossolano. È semplicemente un errore di distrazione, l’ennesimo di tanti. 
Inoltre, ho trovato le, uhm, “cutscene” di una lentezza ammorbante. Non essendoci un doppiaggio (a mio avviso necessario), un minimo di movimento e non avendo la possibilità di skippare i dialoghi, stavo lì ad aspettare la fine di una cutscene che mi sembrava così interminabile che, con quel tempo a disposizione, avrei potuto andare a fare il caffè e pulire pure la tazzina. Ribadisco, non mi aspettavo chissà quale rifinitura, però tutti questi difetti nel complesso sono difficili da digerire ed è difficile godersi il videogioco. Inoltre, credo che il tema del bullying non sia stato gestito in maniera corretta. Nel gioco la frase “I’m not a loser” (non sono un perdente) compare ovunque al punto da desensibilizzarti notevolmente sulla causa perorata da Peter. Forse l’ossessione nei confronti di questo nomignolo -loser- è la scintilla che ha fatto scoccare la psicosi del protagonista, ma calmati bro, abbiamo capito. 
Un’altra cosa che mi ha fatto storcere il naso è il titolo stesso: Morphine, titolo del tutto fuorviante, a mio parere. La morfina è un alcaloide contenuto nell’oppio che ha un effetto analgesico, dunque anestetizza il dolore, ti rende più docile, mentre nel videogioco viene comparato ad un allucinogeno, ad un eccitante, tipo LSD o cocaina. L’errore sta già nel titolo e questo la dice lunga sul risultato raffazzonato.

[b] Pro del gioco: [/b] 
+ Costo irrisorio
+ Trama discreta
+ Abbastanza spaventoso, c’è stato qualche jumpscare iniziale, soprattutto se si gioca con le cuffie ad alto volume
+ I rimandi costanti a Donnie Darko con trip psichedelici quasi comici: alla fine quel coniglio diventa praticamente un bestie visto che è onnipresente
+ Atmosfera disturbante
[b] Contro del gioco: [/b] 
- Pieno di bug, programmato male, con una quantità notevole di errori tecnici 
- Errori piuttosto impietosi nella traduzione inglese
- Mancanza di doppiaggio e lentezza delle “cutscene”, parecchio tediose

[b] Consiglieresti questo gioco? [/b] 
È un ni. Oggettivamente no, soggettivamente sì. Propendo di più verso il sì solo perché il costo è veramente irrisorio, per cui l’asticella delle aspettative deve essere relazionata al costo effettivo del prodotto. E inoltre io amo i trip mentali e i conigli, soprattutto quelli creepy. Ce la fa per il rotto della cuffia.

2014'ten beri Dcs World oynuyorum.Daha önceden sadece F-15, A-10a  modülünü kullanmıştım.Bunu da tavsiyeler, yorumlar üzerine 6 ay kadar önce Blackshark 2 ile birlikte almaya karar verdim.İndirimde de 480 TL'ye yakın bir fiyata satın aldım.Öncelikle şunu belirteyim...Simülasyon oyunlarına ilgim olmasına rağmen delisi değilim. MFS 2020 için Xbox X aldım. Dcs'in farklı sürümlerinde 7-8 senedir oynuyorum. Xplane 11 vs vs...Yani velhasıl kelam az buçuk görmüşlüğüm var.

Ancak bu nedir abi....
O hırlama, o titreme, o güç, o hava, o karizma, o doğallık....
Bendeki sistem günümüze göre ortalama...Dcs World'un da optimizasyonu malum çok iyi değil.Ama bir modül bu kadar mı keyif verir.Bu kadar mı güzel, bu kadar mı kaliteli olur.
Yaptığınız manevraya göre uçağın verdiği tepkiler; titremesi, hırlaması, sallanmadan kaynaklı sesler...
Kokpit detayı ve doğallığı çok iyi, çok kaliteli.
Özellikle LANTIRN'ın olması, bunun verdiği hava-yer görevleri, ''İT DALAŞLARI''... bunları yaşamanız lazım.

Artı olarak bir kaç sıralama yapmak isterim;

 *Gece görüşünün varlığı... (LANTIRN'ı gece operasyonlarında kullanmak ayrı bir keyif veriyor.5-6 ay önce gelen güncelleme ile de Jester artık ayrıntılı seçenek imkanı ile otomatik kilit atabiliyor yer hedeflerine)
 *Koltuk değiştirerek Jester'ın görevlerini devralmanız.(Zaten iki koltuğun kullanımda olması başlı başına yeterli.Arka kısım zaten işin beyni ve orası daha ayrıntılı...)
 *JESTER'ın varlığı...Arada yaptıkları, söyledikleri, verdiği tepkiler...Tek uçarken de kendinizi yalnız hissetmiyorsunuz ;)
 *Modül ile birlikte gelen Kampanya ve tekli görevlerin bolluğu.(Zaten editörden tek başına senaryo kursan dahi yeter.Ayrıca hem Kafkasya hem de Basra haritasına özgü DLC'li veya ücretsiz görevler, kampanyalarda bu modül için var diye de biliyorum.)
 *İt dalaşları anlatılmaz. Hedefi takip ederken, çıplak göz ile ararken verdiği aksiyon bambaşka...
 *Güdümsüz bombalama da; o aşağıya doğru dalıştaki keyif apayrı...
 *Örneğin MFS 2020 uçak dolu ancak neredeyse hiçbiri tam fonksiyonlu, tam simüle değil.Bu neredeyse, tam 100 de 100 olmasa da  hem kokpit içi, hem genel fiziki uçak tepkisi, elektroniği vs olarak tam simüleye yakın...Neredeyse tam olarak Fonksiyonların çoğu tıklanabiliyor, kullanılabiliyor. 

Ancak almayı düşünenlere bir kaç hatırlatma yapmak isterim.

+Malum uçak eski.Bildiğim kadarı ile Kilobaytlar ile ölçülebilecek bilgisayar sistemleri kullanıyor :) Yani görev öncesi maksimum 3 waypoint atanabiliyor.Ancak siz sonradan bu waypointleri firmanın sağladığı kolaylık ile harita yarımıyla veya manuel olarak değiştirebiliyorsunuz.Ayrıca birkaç farklı navigasyon modu mevcut; bunları da, TACAN'ı da kullanarak yolunuzu bulabilirsiniz.(LANTIR'ı bile NAV-GPS olarak kullanan varmış) Dediğim gibi Navigasyon mevcut ancak GPS yok.Bu beni şok etmişti.Ben zannediyorum ki Course'a alırım arkama yaslanırım bu kendi gider.Ancak öyle değil, kontrol uçuş boyu sizde....Autopilot ise daha bu Mart gibi büyük güncellemesi geldi, çok fazla modu yok.Onuda uçuş pozisyonunuz uygun ise sağlıklı kullanabiliyorsunuz.(İrtifa,HDG,rota sapmasına karşı ve iniş için az mod seçeneği var)
+Arka koltuğa geçtiğinizde öndeki pilota verebileceğiniz emirler kısıtlı.Bildiğim kadarı ile firma bununla ilgili bir büyük bir geliştirme yapmayacak.Yani siz arkada iken öndeki pilot it dalaşı, hava muharebesi vs. yapamıyor.Ancak arkadan; yönlendirme komutu vererek gideceği rotayı, dönüş açısını, yanlış hatırlamıyorsam Orbit yapmasını söyleyebiliyorsunuz.
+Hava-hava muharebelerinde Jester'ın(YZ) radardan tespit ve kitlenme ile ilgili derin-ciddi eksiklikleri var.Kitlenme ve angaje olmak bazen imkansız oluyor.Hiç işe yaramıyor değil; yüzeysel olarak kitlenme, hedef seçimi yapıyor ama detaylı olarak seçim kısıtlı. Bunun için arka koltukta; kilitlenme ve radarda hedef değiştirme işini ya manuel yapmanız ya da Jester'ın kullanım arayüzünden ayrıntılı, yakın hava savaşında sizi ciddi engelleyecek şekilde komut vermeniz gerekiyor.Ama bence bu da LANTIRN gibi düzeltilecektir, kolaylaştırılacaktır diye düşünüyorum.
+Uçak çok narin, yüksek G'lere gelemiyor, hemen parçalanıyor.Biraz yüklendiğinizde zaten anlıyorsunuz.Sizinde it dalaşların da, yaptığınız manevralarda ona göre davranmanız gerekiyor.
+Autopilot kullanması biraz zor, ancak dediğim gibi son gelen büyük güncelleme ile biraz kolaylaştırılmış, geliştirilmiş.Sıkıntı yaşarsanız ''-ki uçağı öğrenirken yaşamanız, bir şeyleri eksikmiş, eksik yapmışlar gibi hissetmeniz normal'' internette ki videolara bakabilirsiniz.''MANUEL'' i de oldukça detaylı ve geniş.
+F-14A ve F-14B oyunda beraber geliyor.Ancak aralarındaki farkları teknik olarak tam bilmiyorum.Anladığım kadarıyla motorları farklı...AKINCI-A  AKINCI-B gibi...F-14A bana daha zayıf, daha narin gibi geldi.
+Modülden kaynaklı fps düşüşü oluyor. Kokpit yüksek çözünürlüklü olduğundan grafik/sistem ayarlarından texture seçeneğini medium'a alın. Diğer türlü fps drop yiyorsunuz.
Böyle... Modül hala erken erişimde.Geliştirmesi, güncellenmesi devam ediyor.Eğer sisteminiz yeterli ise, merakınız varsa Parasına acınmayacak, size küçükte olsa hayatınızda tat bırakacak, birinci sınıf, ender bir eser.
İncelememi modülün pahalı olmasından, almayı düşünüp tereddüt edenlere yardımcı olması için biraz uzun tuttum.Umarım faydalı olmuştur.
Yukarıda söylediklerimde benden kaynaklı hata, yanlış yönlendirme umarım olmamıştır.
Şimdiden iyi keyifler...

**Bu arada kamera modunu ''camera jiggle mod'' (shift+J bir kaç kere basmanız gerekiyor tam modu için ve havada iken açın ki açıldığını anlayabilesiniz.Kameraya sanki gerçekten uçak içindeymiş gibi titreme efekti veriyor.İlkel fsrealistic gibi...) ve ''natural head movement''(Win+F1) kullanarak uçmanızı tavsiye ederim.**",0,turkish

If you want a depression simulator, games like ""when the Darkness comes"" are FAR superior.

0,steam_reviews/417880_EverybodysGonetotheRapture.json,1495,1,"(The tl;dr version: [i]Everybody's Gone to the Rapture[/i] is an exquisitely beautiful but ultimately self-indulgent and tedious game that fails to satisfy.)

We now know that hell is an English countryside...but let me backtrack. First there was [i]Dear Esther[/i], with its unindulgent, lyrical narrative that created a haunting but earnest experience, somewhere between [i]Shutter Island[/i] and [i]Pale Fire[/i]. Next, there was [i]Stanley Parable[/i], the game that set the bar for the postmodern-first-person-exploration-game genre: there were interesting settings, clever narration, and overall Kafkaesque dread ([i]Dr. Langeskov[/i] finessed the concept even further). Finally, there was [i]Gone Home[/i], which took the genre to the logical conclusion, achieving full-bodied, emotive storytelling using all the same tools.

While [i]Rapture[/i] has elements of all these games, it fails more and more miserably on the whole. Calling it ""a spiritual successor"" to [i]Dear Esther[/i] is quite inaccurate (if not outright insulting...were it not made by the same studio). To be sure, this game is gorgeous. It makes the most of CryEngine and it shows the tremendously meticulous care its designers put into model and texture development. However, where its predecessors deliver a seamless experience, [i]Rapture[/i] ends up overthinking many practical aspects of gameplay, resulting in nothing less than growing exasperation.

First of all, [i]Dear Esther[/i] let the player simply wander around, the dialogue simply ""filling in"" the environment without special participation from the player, allowing the game to be linear while maintaining the illusion of choice. [i]Rapture[/i], on the other hand, confuses the hell out of the player by mixing ""visions"" of the inhabitants of the abandoned village (that appear without any intervention) with the rather laborious mechanic of ""tuning"" the anomalies to produce...exactly the same kind of visions (sans the dramatic dimming of lights). Speaking of the anomaly tuning, the console-mechanics nonsense of dragging my mouse around (this makes zero sense on the PC) resulted in me turning off the ""hard-mode"" tuning almost immediately. The entire experience was also extremely repetitive.

More importantly, an insufficient amount of thought was put into delivering the backstory. While [i]Gone Home[/i] seamlessly turns on narration in the form of diary entries ([i]BioShock[/i] also does this quite well), leaving the player to roam while listening to the background story, [i]Rapture[/i] tethers these soundbites to radios and cell phones (in the first place, how do these hold recorded messages?!), requiring the player to wait near the sound source for the dialogue between two or more ""characters"" to finish (the sound source even ""conveniently"" shuts itself off at a certain distance).

The storytelling itself is disjointed; however, while this is a plus in all the aforementioned games, in [i]Rapture[/i] it makes for a drawn-out and painfully uninteresting plotline. After the wonder of the initial few minutes, I felt no suspense whatsoever and no connection to any of the characters. This brings me to the most important point. While the aforementioned games put a lot of effort into making exploration and endless walking not only a sort of redemption of the ""walking simulator"" genre but also very interesting per se ([i]Dear Esther[/i] accomplished this using stunning landscapes, [i]Gone Home[/i] did this by allowing rich interaction with objects in the environment), almost *nothing* in [i]Rapture[/i] can be touched or viewed, making for an extremely tedious experience precisely because the rich, beautiful environments of the game turns out to be nothing but a one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that the player cannot really interact with.

As far as the overall interaction with the game, there's also something unpolished about the exploration mechanics. To wit, it's very possible to miss a key place in the first ""stage"" (that weird ball of light goes around in circles) and end up wandering around the sprawling map for a good 30 minutes (or more) in real time, looking for the next QuickTime event that would let you to proceed to the next ""stage"" (in the second ""stage"" the ball of light moves more purposefully, like an eager puppy pointing the way). The tormented player begins to wonder: Why is walking in this game so slow? Why does the [i]run[/i] functionality not work? I would be able to finish the game in more than half the time (and enjoy it a whole lot more!) if I didn't have to slog through the 1980s British countryside at 5 KPH.

Technical issues also abound: halfway through, the game began to throw me back to Windows every time I clicked a door and the screen began to stutter every time I clicked a radio. Clearly, playtesting was not very high on the list of priorities here. Don't get me wrong. A lot of love went into designing this game, and it's obvious that its makers are fans of a number of excellent science fiction writers (the Philip K. D!ck [seriously? Steam censors the name?] references are obvious, but I was especially delighted by the passing little references to the Strugatsky Brothers' [i]Roadside Picnic[/i]). Having said this, the love in [i]Rapture[/i] is terribly misdirected. This is what happens when designers are led astray by a the misguided desire to make a high-concept commercial product.

I'm a patient man, but I ultimately gave up on [i]Rapture[/i] after 4 hours. Before you say I have too brief an attention span, I enjoyed [i]Dr. Langeskov[/i] for 80 minutes, [i]Dear Esther[/i] for 108 minutes, [i]Gone Home[/i] for 2 hours, and [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] for 6 hours. If you played any of these games, you know they do not take that long to finish; rather, it's a joy to explore the additional nooks and crannies when the main storyline is over. I'm a sucker for a good story, but this time not even that made me stick with the game. Between the narration and game mechanics, I simply became frustrated.

A word of advice to the studio: give ""presence born from absence"" (to use your own words) a rest and try some presence born from presence.",272,english

Mekanikleri ve fizik motoru gerçekten iyi seviyede oynayışı da keyifli. Bulmacaları gayet iyi diyebilirim. Paranızın her kuruşunu hak eden bir oyun. Beğenmeyenlerin hikayeyi anlamadığını veya türe aşina olmadığını düşünüyorum. İndirimli veya indirimsiz mutlaka bu oyunu deneyimlemelisiniz. 

10/10

Ben biraz Little Nightmares'deki göndermelerden, metaforlardan ve hikayenin işleyişinden bahsetmek istiyorum. Öncelikle oyunu oynarken İnside oyunu ile benzerliğini görünce anladım ki hikayenin işleyiş şekli İnside gibi olacak ve hikaye arka planda anlatılacak, önümüze direkt olarak sunulmayacak, yorumlamaya açık olacak. Limbo Like türünü en üst seviyelere taşıyan oyunlardan birisi Little Nightmares. Oyunu oynarken tam anlamıyla hikayeyi anlamak istiyorsanız dikkat etmeniz gereken şey sadece size gösterilenlere değil arkaya da bakmalısınız. Oyun tamamıyla metaforik ve üstü kapalı anlatım olduğu için yorumlamaya çok müsait. Benim gördüklerimden bahsedeceğim, siz de kendi yorumlarınızla sentezlerseniz çok daha iyi olacaktır.


Little Nightmares'de ana karakterin bir çocuk olması  (İnside'da da ana karakter çocuktur.) başlı başına masumiyeti, temizliği, yabancılığı ve daha yolun başında olduğumuzu gösteriyor. Nedendir bilinmez bize göre devasa bir gemide uyanması, uyanır uyanmaz ayağa kalkıp yürümesi aslında kendimizi birdenbire dünyada bulmamıza ve gözümüzü açar açmaz daha burada neden olduğumuzu anlayamadan mücadele etmeye başlamamıza bir gönderme. Oyundaki gemi metaforu dünyayı simgeliyor. İlerledikçe karşımıza yeni zorluklar çıkıyor ve bu zorlukları kendi başımıza halletmemiz bekleniyor ancak biz daha yeni gözlerimizi açmıştık ve bilgisiziz. Bir başımıza zorluklarla mücadele ederek ilerlerken bir yandan henüz yeni uyandığımız bu gemiyi anlamaya çalışıyoruz. ""Bunlar kim? Neden buradayım? Bana neden saldırıyorlar ben onlara ne yaptım?"" gibi sorularla beraber ilerliyoruz; kendimizi buraya yabancı hissediyoruz,korkuyoruz ve geminin karşımıza daha hangi zorlukları çıkaracağını düşünüyoruz. 

  Karşımıza çıkan herkes nefret ve öfke dolu. Bizi gördükleri an saldırıyorlar ve bizi öldürmek istiyorlar. Bunun sebebi yabancı olmamız aslında, onların dünyasına giren yabancı bir tür gibiyiz, insanların ötekiye bakışını çok iyi anlatmış oyun bize. Kafka Dönüşüm kitabında olduğu gibi bizi böcek gibi görüp ezmek istiyorlar. Bazen sarılma ihtiyacı duyuyoruz, içimizdeki sevgi duygusu bize saldıranlardan kendimizi ayıran en önemli şey aslında. İnsanlarla karşılaşıyoruz, ancak insan demek güç. Neredeyse birbirlerini yiyorlar, boğulurcasına önlerindekini yiyip başkalarının yemeklerini kolaçan ediyorlar. Kafalarını bir an olsun önündeki yemekten kaldırıp etraflarına bakmıyorlar ve sadece bizi fark ettiklerinde bize saldırmak için kafalarını kaldırıyorlar. Buradaki yemek metaforu para ve kapitalizmi simgeliyor. Bizim açlıktan midemiz kazınıyor ve neredeyse ayakta yürüyemiyoruz ama onlar önlerindekini paylaşmayı geçtim bizi bile yemek istiyorlar. Ortama uyumsuz olan bizi yakalayıp yok etmek istiyorlar çünkü biz hala insani duygulara sahibiz. Onları ben domuzlara benzettim fakat George Orwell'in Hayvan Çiftliğinde de olduğu gibi belki de domuzlar insan olmuştur? 

  Bir başka dikkatimi çeken şey son bölümdeki kadın karakterin maske ile gezmesi, evindeki tüm aynaların kırılmış olması ve ona ayna göstererek yendikten sonra ağlayarak yere düşmesiydi. Bu bölüm gerçekten çok etkileyiciydi. Günümüzde insanlara baktığımızda aslında oyunun bize bu bölümde anlatmak istediği şey çok açık. Kimse kendisi ile barışık değil; sosyal medyada hep ben çok iyiyim havaları, yüz filtreleri, sürekli mutlu olduğunu göstermeler, aşırı makyaj ve estetik isteği, ideal tip olamadığında depresyona girmeler ve toplumdan dışlanma. Oyunda bu kişiye ayna göstererek yani kendisini kendine göstererek ona aslında ne olduğunu göstermeye çalışıyoruz ve işin sonunda maskesi düşüyor geriye kendi özü kalıyor ama uzun zamandır görmediği yüzü, karakterini kısacası kendini görünce ağlıyor, üzüntüsünden yere düşüyor maalesef. 

SPOİLER!!!

Oyunun sonlarına doğru hiç yapmayacağımız bir şey yapıyoruz; daha önce sarıldığımız ve sevgi gösterdiğimiz minik bir hayvanı canlı canlı yiyoruz, bir insanı öldürüyoruz. Gemide kala kala biz de herkes gibi oluyoruz aslında. Kendimize bakıyoruz yaptığımız şeye inanamıyoruz ama iş işten geçti artık .Tüm insani duygularımızı kaybediyoruz ve en sonunda gemiden (dünyadan) ayrılıyoruz. 

Çok ama çok etkileyici bir oyun. Birkaç kez oynamak arka planı anlayabilmek için daha iyi olabilir. İkinci oyunu mutlaka oynamak istiyorum. Eğer bu tarz oyunları çok seviyorsanız mutlaka Limbo ve İnside'a bakınız. İnside daha çok kapitalizm göndermeleri barındırıyor Little Nightmares'de ise daha çok sosyolojik ve psikolojik göndermeler var.",340,turkish

0,steam_reviews/435300_WeKnowtheDevil.json,815,1,"First of all, I really liked the atmosphere, the art, the music but....

Man, this story does not like you. As a member of the LGBT+ community, I was looking forward to this, but it doesn't want you to know what's going on. Usually, that's not a problem for me (I love Baroque and I love Kafka and some seriously obtuse indie bands), but this was more reminiscent of when I was seventeen and tried really hard to be deep about things and cared more about myself than an audience, which was fine, because I wasn't publishing anything. 

But this is published and with the way it's written, it's really inaccessible. I went through, trying to think of my high school students playing this (I was an English teacher for a while) and I just imagine them giving me the Look and leaving me with a silent class for 30 minutes because they wouldn't know what to say. The only reason I knew there were LGBT+ themes in it was the marketing done prior and word of mouth from friends. If I hadn't known that already, I wouldn't have known that was the approach to the story while I played it. 

I'm glad there are people that love it. Maybe I'm too trained to be critical when approaching written pieces because of my schooling and perhaps this needs to be approached at its face instead of being picked through, but I think the author really needs to think about how much they're writing for themselves and how much they are wanting to write for other people. Who is their audience? What are they meant to get from this? Would a person be able to get what the author intends for them to get from this without discussion boards, prior marketing, etc.? Does the material by itself deliver what it needs to deliver? 

There is a lot of potential here. There are a lot of good elements here. I think, ultimately, all that it needs is the author stepping back away from the story and looking at it from the eye of a reader. A good revision and I think there would be a lot of great things that could come out of this.",101,english
0,steam_reviews/437250_AHouseofManyDoors.json,388,1,"To me it's clear that [i]A House of Many Doors[/i] is a title worth recommending. It's a weird, textheavy RPG in a kafka- and lovecraft-esque universe filled with odd characters and locations and merges mechanics from textadventures, roguelights and turn based strategy. The writing is reasonably strong and has a few unique ideas tossed in. It comes with a few caveats though, and one can't avoid comparisons to the tonally and mechanically very similar [i]Sunless Sea[/i] (I heard that some of the Failbetter games devs helped out a bit with this one) as well as other games like [i]FTL - Faster Than Light[/i]. 

So let us pull out the sting before we talk about the good stuff.

It is not quite as polished as the previously mentioned titles. The map for example slows down the framerate significantly. the interface is a bit of a mess (to be fair, same goes for [i]Sunless Sea[/i]) and typos and grammatical errors are frequent enough to bother me a wee bit. It also has a habit of stepping on its own toes in an attempt to improve some of the issues present in [i]Sunless Sea[/i]. It shows nowhere more strongly than in the way it handles map traversal. You see: in SS, traversing the Unterzee is slow, grueling and dangerous. AHoMD in comparison ups the tempo, strength and maneuverability of its craft and is more forgiving with its resources than SS, but loses some of the tension that hammers home the fragility of your vessel and the cruelty of the environment. To me, this makes the traversal through The House actually more tedious than cruising through the Unterzee, even though it is much shorter. Not helping are the repeating and oftentimes samey looking rooms of the house and the overall less vibrant setdesigns. Personally I also think that the writing here isn't [i]quite[/i] as strong and varied as in SS. It is by no means bad though.

So, now that's out of my system, I can talk about the improvements over its spiritual predecessor.

Personally, I think the sanity system is much better visualized in this game. In SS, decreasing sanity would change the music and trigger appropriate events, but that was it for the most part. AHoMD is a bit more creative in that regard. The music changes as well, but also puts details like font changes and a glitchy hud in the mix. Those are small details, but they add a lot of atmosphere. 
The combat, while being a rather clunky reimagening of FTL, is also more interesting and demanding than just cruising around in circles and pressing a button.
But the biggest improvement are the interactions with your crewmembers. SS had those as well, but the ways you could interact with them were rather limited and required often a specific items or events. AHoMD gives you way more options to chatter with your simply but solidly written crewmates. Your various relationships with them can also trigger special events and overall give you a reason to stick with your statswise rather rubbish startercrew.

tl;dr:

[i]A House of Many Doors[/i] is a very ambitious reimagening of [i]Sunless Sea[/i]. While it doesn't quite stick the landing mechanically and writingwise, its take on the formula is certainly refreshing and brings some welcome changes. 
If you haven't played the title from Failbetter Games and can deal with a few kinks, I can recommend this game without hesitation.

Após ter finalizado a leitura desse, tive que começar a conhecer um pouco mais sobre a literatura de Franz Kafka para conseguir implementar minha visualização sobre pessoas que são vistas como seres fúteis pela maioria da sociedade e que para serem minimante aceitas precisam se manter em um trabalho, e que sem ele, podem ser consideradas completamente inúteis (como no caso de Gregor Samsa na obra ""A Metamorfose"") e criticar coisas que podem ser consideradas desiguais e ineficientes que ninguém tem coragem de questionar (como a crítica ao sistema penal em ""A Colônia Penal"", onde o protagonista nem sabe pelo o que está sendo julgado). Depois de adquirir mais conhecimentos sobre literatura e matemática, precisei estudar linguagens de programação para conseguir entender o funcionamento dos mecanismos desse jogo. Estudei C++ para entender o funcionamento da Engine que foi responsável por nos proporcionar essa oitava maravilha do mundo. Depois de estudar por muito tempo, consegui criar meu próprio Kernel e desenvolver um compilador para ver se eu já estava apto para entender o básico desse jogo. Para as pessoas que não tem capacidade intelectual suficiente para entender a complexidade existente nesse jogo, pode parecer que eu já fiz muita coisa, mas para quem realmente é uma pessoa brilhante que consegue entender as críticas sociais e os questionamentos filosóficos, precisei avançar mais ainda em minha jornada para conseguir entender o jogo. Precisei cursar Engenharia Elétrica para ver sobre circuitos e otimizar mais ainda meu conhecimento para ver os sistemas elétricos por trás da máquina que teria o privilégio de conseguir rodar o jogo. Depois de mais alguns anos de estudos, precisei estudar várias línguas para deixar meu cérebro preparado para conseguir aprimorar meu raciocínio para conseguir ficar próximo de compreender o que estava ocorrendo nessa obra-prima. Estudei polonês, alemão e dinamarquês e viajar pelo mundo a fora para conseguir ver sobre as mais variadas culturas que estão espalhadas pelo mundo e ter uma bagagem maior de conhecimentos para conseguir, enfim, entender o que se passa na história do melhor jogo que já joguei em minha vida.

Eigentlich ist jedes weitere Wort zuviel der Aufmerksamkeit für dieses Werk.

Kubistische, minimalistische Räume, minimalistische Farbgebung, symbolübefrachtete Objekte, Ein Lift, der uns in verschiedene Ebenen der Stadt bringt, die aber letztlich nur aus vielleicht sieben Schauplätzen besteht, keine Kinder, keine Menschen, nur Aliens, eine KZ-ähnlich Fabrik, eine kafkaeske Einwanderungsbehörde, eine absurde Polizei.

Ja, ich weiss: die Ausbeutung der Illegalen, die pauschalen Verdächtigungen, die übermächtige Bürokratie, etc. Aber wichtige Themen allein, machen das Spiel nicht gut.

Warum erscheinen auch die Ärzte böse? Was sollen die Fernseher bei der Polizei? Warum ist die Kirche kein warmer, schützender, sondern kalter Ort voller Zombies? Warum auch noch das Thema Überwachungsstaat? Was hat der mit der Kirche und das dann mit dem Immigration Office zu tun? Welche Mutter (Merkel?) muss mit den Steinen aus einer Mine gefüttert werden, in der er schuftet? Das allermeiste hier ergibt für mich absolut keinen Sinn.

Das starke Gefälle zwischen den sozialen Schichten, die Gossensprache Sigils, Cant, die durch die Recherche von Werken, die die unteren Gesellschaftsschichten des Elisabethanischen Zeitalters beleuchten, entstanden ist und durch selbsterfundene Begrifflichkeiten ergänzt wurde, sowie die ausdifferenzierten Arbeiterbezirke und ihre Lebenswelt, der existenziell-bedrohliche Alltag, der einem emotional unter die Haut geht, der einem mitfühlen lässt...das alles sind Alleinstellungsmerkmale des Planescape Settings...die Welt wirkt unglaublich lebendig und ausgefeilt!
Es ist wie ein mit Phantasmen angereichertes Abbild unserer Gesellschaft inklusive ihrer Missstände.
Es ist wie ein Gesellschaftsportrait mit der Surrealistik eines Salvador Dali und einer guten Portion kafkaesker Absurdität.

Sigil ist prächtig aber auch düster und dreckig, die Ebenen sind schön ebenso wie grausam, die Fraktionen sind im ständigen Zwist miteinander.
Sie vermitteln Lebensanschauungen und Wege mit dem Lebensalltag umzugehen. 
Man kann sie mit real bestehende Glaubens-Strömungen identifizieren, dennoch sind sie etwas ganz Neues, Eigenständiges.
Ich habe es geliebt, alles über ihre Ideen zu erfahren, über ihre Credos und Leitfäden für das Leben und Miteinander im Multiversum.
Dass man sich im Spiel entscheiden kann, welcher Fraktion man letztlich angehören will, war ein sehr netter Aspekt.
Auch wenn einige Fraktionen nicht wirklich storyrelevant sind und kaum Questreihen bieten, so sind sie extrem gut konzipiert und bieten die interessanteste Auswahl, die ich in einem Spiel je erlebt habe.
Ich habe mich wirklich mit den Fragen auseinandergesetzt - welcher Fraktion würde ich angehören? welche Fraktion passt zu unserem namenlosen Protagonisten?
Und eben solche Fragen über die man nachgrübeln kann, Rollen, in die man sich hinein zu versetzen sucht, das macht ein richtig gutes RPG aus. Dass man nicht nur oberflächlich die Haupt-Storyline abarbeitet und unwillig ein paar Nebenquests erledigt, um mit dem Level der Gegner mithalten zu können und das nötige Kleingeld für uninspirierte - aber in den Item-Stats bessere - Ausrüstung zu kaufen.
Nein, dass man überlegt, WER in dieser Welt will ich sein?
Und die Dinge nicht dem Zweck zu Liebe macht und die Mittel überdenkt die man einsetzt, um in der Welt seinen Platz zu finden und dem Streben des Hauptcharakters eine persönliche Note zu verleihen.

Es ist ein Jammer, dass sich Torment : Tides of Numenera nicht mehr dem Planescape Setting bedienen konnte...
Denn das Planescape-Setting ist das interessanteste, tiefgründigste, philosophisch-wertvollste Setting, dass ich mit für ein Rollenspiel vorstellen kann. (kein weiteres Swords-and-Sorcery Fantasy Fiction Setting, das sich mit Beliebigkeit, mit Schonmal-Da-Gewesenem zu behaupten versucht)
Und es ist in jeder Hinsicht in sich schlüssig.
So wie auch Planescape: Torment in jeder Hinsicht in sich schlüssig war, jeder Nebenstrang fügte sich nahtlos in das große Ganze ein, kein Charakter und keine Quest wirkten aus dem Kontext gerissen oder überflüssig.
Alles hatte seinen Sinn und trug dazu bei eine ganzheitliche Erfahrung zu vermitteln.

Ein ganz großes Lob muss ich auch für die innovativen Item-Ideen aussprechen. Endlich mal keine Heil- und Effektränke, sondern interessante, wenn auch sehr morbide aufbrauchbare Items wie Blutfliegentalismane, Leichenfliegentalismane, 
Natterntränen, Holzkohletalismane oder Items wie ein Pfefferminzbonbon, das Charisma und den Zauber 'Freundschaft' verleiht, der ""Gordische-Knoten"", der einem beim einfältigen Lösen mit der scharfen Klinge, arrogant und selbstbewusst macht und so das Charisma permanent steigert, einem aber einen Hauch von Weisheit nimmt.
Auch die Waffen sind sehr besonders, wie ein Metzgerbeil (der Butcherer of Innocents), das nur angelegt werden kann, wenn man schon eine gewisse Anzahl Morde begangen hat und böser Gesinnung ist, einem aber nützlicherweise etwas Leben von jedem Gegner raubt. Um nur ein Beispiel zu nennen.
Noch nie habe ich solche spannenden Itembeschreibungen/Hintergrundinformationen zu Gegenständen und solch eine Vielfalt von ambivalenten Effekten zu sehen bekommen, bei denen man abwägen muss, was man in Kauf zu nehmen bereit ist...
Es stört auch gar nicht, dass es mit Rüstungsteilen nicht besonders weit her ist, denn die Individualität der charaktereigenen Ausrüstungsslots (der Namenlose kann beispielsweise sein Auge wechseln und präparierte Organe ausrüsten, Morte kann seine Zähne tauschen) und das einmalige Tattoo-System machen das locker wett.
So kann man im Laufe seiner Abenteuer aus einer immer größeren Auswahl an Tattoos auswählen, die einem die verschiedensten Boni geben.
Je nach abgeschlossenen Quests - wie man diese abgeschlossen hat zählt dabei auch- bietet der Inhaber des Tattooladens, Fell, neue Tättowierungen an, die in die Ausrüstungsslots gelegt werden können, wenn man die entsprechenden Voraussetzungen erfüllt. Neben den erwähnten Boni erzählen diese Tattoos, auch etwas über die Etappen der erlebten Abenteuer. So wird unser Protagonist quasi zu einem wandelnden Buch (Nun ja, eine Art lebendes Journal ist er ja ohnehin bereits :D...)

Mit einem weiteren Lob möchte ich meine Rezension nun abschließen...
Nämlich einem ganz großen Lob an die Begleiter, die man während des Spiels antrifft!
Diese sind wundervoll ausgearbeitet, extrem vielschichtig und geben im Lauf der Zeit, in kleinen Häppchen, immer wieder Informationen über sich preis, allerdings manchmal nur, wenn die Moral - das Vertrauen - entsprechend hoch ist.
Es fehlt auch nicht an Interaktion zwischen den Charakteren, es gibt gruppeninterne Konflikte - Abneigungen und Besorgnis. Jeder hat eine Meinung über den anderen, die manchmal mehr, manchmal weniger, also subtiler, ersichtlich ist.
Dass man zu den Begleitern eine gewisse Sympathie (oder auch Abneigung) entwickeln kann, geht sicherlich auch aus meinem Profilbild hervor.
Die Charaktere bieten Anlass zur Identifikation, zum Mitfiebern und Mitleiden...und das ist etwas, was bei weitem nicht viele Spiele auf diesem Niveau erreichen.
Besonders Fall-From-Grace wird immer einen speziellen Platz in meinem Leben haben.

..So wie dieses Meisterwerk immer einen besonderen Platz in meinem Leben haben wird, und vor allen anderen Spielen immer die unumstößliche Nummer 1 für mich sein wird.
Planescape: Torment lieferte mir viele schöne Momente, lieferte mir Trost in schweren Zeiten und hat mich zu vielen neuen Gedanken und dem Überdenken alter Gedankenmuster angeregt. Es lieferte Ideen und Erlebnisse zum Schwärmen, zum Träumen, zum Sinnieren und war zu jederzeit in meinem Leben in gewisser Form mental präsent. Ich bin sehr dankbar, dass dieses Spiel mich durch mein Leben hinweg begleiten durfte. Und ich hoffe, dass es noch vielen anderen Menschen ein so treuer Gefährte, oder auch einfach nur eine so tolle Erfahrung sein kann!

aber wer lust hat mit anderen leuten zu spielen, auf den echtzeit und strategie und mitelälter charakter steht sollte es auf jedenfall antesten

ich spiele es seit einem jahr ca., der anfang ist in vielen punkten langsam schleppend und wenn man ständiog von anderen angegriffen und plat gemacht wird sehr unspaßig aber dieses spiel setzt auf zeit und wachstum, das häuserprinzip mit seinen strukturen und den verschieden regeln der welte ist fesseln, es macht viel spaß man kann es auf verschiedene art und weisen spielen

dazu ist es ein komplettes kriegsspiel also es kann sein wenn man nicht aufpasst kommt man morgens online und alles ist weg, was für mich einen großen reiz ausmacht


ich kann es nur jedem wärmstens empfehlen für mich ein spiel mit viel spaß.

HIER NOCH EINE ANMERKUNG:

da es leider einem Mitspieler nicht möglich ist hier eine Review zu posten übernehme ich das für ihn und ich hoffe sehr das er auch berückstichtig wird

################################################################################


Däumchen hoch für dieses Spiel.

Es ist ein Spiel, wo die Neueinsteiger ein bisschen was zu kniffeln haben. Sie müssen erfolgreich Quest, Ränge aufsteigen, neue Kontakte zu Spieler/in knüpfen um erfolgreich zu sein.

Je größer man vom Rang wird, desto größere Aufgaben bestehen ein vor. Man kann selber entscheiden ob man alleine antretet oder sich einer Fraktion bzw Haus anschließt und somit das Teamwork in dem Gameplay fördert.

Durch regelmäßige Befragung der Spieler, wird dieses Spiel von Jahr zu Jahr verbessert, sind es neue Karten oder Quest.
Man wählt einen eigenen Weg, welchen man gehen mag ein Kriegsspieler oder lieber Supporter.

Was das Gameplay direkt betrifft, baut man sein Dorf in 2 Richtungen einmal die ""Landwirtschaft"" und auf der anderen Seite seine militärische Burg.

Wer Krieg spielen mag oder das klassische Burgenbau liebt, ist bei Stronghold genau richtig.
Das Spiel umfasst noch viel viel mehr, aber um das heraus zu finden,spielt es am besten selber.

En resumen: The lion's song es una aventura narrativa con tres historias bien desarrolladas que muestran a través de la música, la pintura y la ciencia algunos de los cambios que influenciaron el siglo XX. En lo personal me gustaron sus refencias al psicoanálisis de Freud y a la literatura con La metaforfosis de Kafka, dos austriacos que enriquecen la atmósfera, no sólo artística sino también de invención y extrañeza que mantiene el juego a lo largo de sus cuatro capítulos. Y como dos puntos negativos, al menos para mí, están la nula variedad de mecánicas y la ausencia de cierto reto al ir avanzando, pues prácticamente la jugabilidad se limita a tener que hacer click aquí y allá hasta el final. Aunque también hay que mencionar que el juego cuenta con toma de decisiones que hace que ciertos momentos se ramifiquen y nos den diferentes finales de cada capítulo. Quizá conocer todas las variantes sea lo único destacable de la jugabilidad, además de su sobresaliente narrativa, atmósfera, diseño artístico, y conmovedora banda sonora. Una joya indie.",0,spanish

[b] [u] [i] Last Man Standing tarzı Total War [/i] [/u] [/b]   [spoiler] İĞRENÇ!!! [/spoiler]

Herhalde oynadığım en kötü Total War oyunu olabilir. Last Man Standing tarzında İlirya, Trakya, Persler, Dahıstan ve İskitlerin bize düşman olduğu ve bizim de kazanmak için 100 tur içinde 10 tane kritik noktayı ya da domiantion (World Conquest)'a giderek 30 bölgeyi ele geçirmeye çalıştığınız bir oyundur kendisi. Oyunda diplomat yok ve ülkeler arası ticaret yok ki zaten hepsi size düşman. Bu da oyunu pata küte dalmaktan öteye taşımıyor. Öte yandan yapabileceğiniz tarihsel savaşlar ve turnuvalar var. Fakat oyun genel olarak aşırı zor ve Campaing'i bitirdikten sonra bunu da Medium da oynayayım dedim, baktım olmuyor sildim geçtim. Oyun dediğim gibi manasız derecede aşırı zor. Campaing'i Medium'da oynamanızı tavsiye ederim.

Size tavsiyem ele geçirdiğiniz yerlerde isyanla uğraşmamak ve hızlı ordu basabilmek adına (çünkü 5 düşmanınız var, oturup gelişmeyi bekleyemezsiniz) ele geçirdiğiniz yerlerde direkt katliam yapın. Hem isyan sıkıntısı kalmayacak hem de elinize yüksek miktarda para geçecektir. Elinize geçen parayı sakın paralı askerlere harcamayın sadece gerektiğinde alın çünkü paralı askerlerin morali çok düşük odluğu için en ufak zorlukta sizi satarlar. Parayla önce Zeus tapınağı, ardından military barrack, sonra stable bir de tarla ve yol yaparsın yeter. Tabi kuşatma esnasında zarar gören yapıları tamir ettirmeyi unutmayın. Eğer baskın kültür olmak isteyip de baskın risklerini azaltmak isterseniz, karşı kültürden olan tüm binaları yıkın gitsin. Ama tabi direkt yıkmayın. Önce barracks ve stable'ı tamir edin ardından ordunuzdaki kayıpları onlarla 'retain' telafi edin sonrasında binaları yıkıp kendi binalarınızı koyun. 

Size tavsiyem önce İlirya'yı, ardından Trakya'yı, bir orduyu anadoluya Pers işgali için diğer orduyu da yukarı denizden gemiyle geçirerek İskitleri bitirmek için. Persler çok yer kaplar ama Dahıstan da sizi hatrı sayılır derecede ordu ile bekliyor olacak. 3. bir ordu ile Afrika'dan gelin. Anadolu'daki ordu sayınızı ikiye çıkarın ki işgali hızınız artsın. Kafkaslarda İskitlerin işi bitince Orta Doğu'ya baskı yapın. En nihayetinde 3-4 orduyu İran'da birleştirin. Buradan tüm vilayetleri alarak ilerlerken bir yandan sizin vilayetlerde isyan olaylarını kontrol altına alın. Tam mutlu sona yaklaşırken Perslerin son kozu olarak Dahıstan'ı göreceksiniz. Zaten onun 1 bölgesi var. Onları da alınca Domination'ı yapmış olursunuz. Tabi ben bunları Medium zorluk seviyesinde yaptım. Hard da hilesiz Domination yapan varsa gider elini öperim.

Medium'da bitiricem derken 36 saatimi yemiş. Yazık valla şu oyuna harcadığım saatlere!

I believe the clue system could have been improved. It literally highlights a set of clues and the only thing left to the player is choosing the relevant ones. It would be better if I had to extract all of the clues by myself. But still, I felt the joy of being an intelligence agent.

To sum up:
If you want some interesting detective story, go watch Castle or Poirot from the 80's
If you want to know how it feels to live in an authoritarian state, go buy ""Papers, Please"", read Orwells ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" or Franz Kafkas ""The Trail"" or anything about the russian KGB, polish UB/SB, german Stasi or Romanian Securitat.

0,steam_reviews/491950_OrwellKeepinganEyeOnYou.json,14077,3,"What you do in this game, is basically read through a linear narrative by dragging ""datachunks"" from right side of your screen to the left. At no point do you have any clue what the consquences might be this time. So sometimes, the dragging of a chunk leads to an arrests and people getting killed, sometimes nothing happens.

All things considered, Orwell is yet another game where you spend most of the time fighting the user interface. Minimal Design strikes once again.

At times, Orwell gives you a really ham-fisted lecture on the value of privacy that would be too cringy even for an elementary school kid. Point in case: one of the protagonists has a fucking Kafka wallpaper on his desktop and his favourite song is ""Die Gedanken sind frei""...
The naivité and carelessness with which the retarded tweeny main cast is using ""social"" media is appalling. Also, I'm pretty sure that a surveillance state would NOT work the way it does in Orwell. In reality, state surveillance is publicly announced so that every citizen thinks twice before saying anything. You wouldn't just introduce total surveillance without anyone knowing (historic example: the Stasi in the German Democratic Republic)
As Mao said: Execute one - educate hundreds.

Addendum:
After a very rough beginning that almost made me quit, I soldiered through the interface and played to the end. Apparently there are multiple endings, but the game forces you to start from scratch and sit through the whole linear experience two (2!)  more times.

You frequently have situations as an alien where you're sitting behind a wall, or a box---not in combat and you find yourself suddenly a corpse. You hear and see maybe 10 gunshots after the fact hitting your body. (happens with as low as 20-40 ping, with a decent server) It sounds like the beginning of a Kafka novel rather than any sort of fun. In combat, as an alien (but also happens -admittedly not as frequently- as the slower Marines) it seems as if you've been afflicted by some sort of invisible alien centipede tail trailing seconds behind that your enemy can shoot to kill you despite you already being safe and well away on your screen.

It's both well-written and utterly depressing.  This is *not* a generic feel-good heroic rah-rah shooter.  In a way, it could even be termed ""survival horror"" in the purest form... the horrors that emerge from within the human mind and form, rather than mere zombies or mutants.

Mechanically, it's fairly prosaic -- third-person, cover-based, regenerating health, a variety of modern weapons, a couple of companions generally.   The checkpoint system is somewhat obnoxious but checkpoints are fairly common, and if you repeatedly fail the game will start providing you with extra ammunition and even suggest lowering the difficulty (which you can do at the cost of restarting your current checkpoint).

It is not a terribly long game, so don't be expecting a 40-hour run. 

There are some technical quirks like encrypted INI files (google around for decryption / encryption utilities) with settings that the menus don't let you change otherwise (notably, depth of field, radial blur... and mouse acceleration!).  It's a minor inconvenience since tools do exist, but just be aware.

0,steam_reviews/504230_Celeste.json,73968,1,"It was at a silent night that a stroke hit me in 2019, not too long after I had begun to try some quiet and peaceful games which, when I’m immersed in, can offer me a closer feeling to myself and purer prospect of the real when I’m out. Celeste was the first one that impressed me, it evokes and deepens the feelings above even today. The next two years was difficult to forget but not easy to recall, except for all the normally supposed troubles and worries that confronted me, one little thing once almost broke me down during recovery was thoughts of never being able to fully enjoy a game like this, which, in further meanings, symbolizes the disability to taste all my life, whether bitter or sweet since my left side may never work well like before. I still remember the feel of jumping, climbing, moving and traveling around the Mountain at will with two hands, that’s splendid. The acquaintance of that is a consequence of about 20000 deaths. Nothing mattered to me like that before, and pessimistically saying, maybe later. Now I have added another 20000 deaths to the data record, though. Reacquiring the faded experience and tricks to accomplish the last longer and harder chapter with only one hand was torture, I couldn’t deny that, but weren’t things exactly the same when I started with no awareness of anything that’s coming afterwards? The numbers are almost equal finally. Regaining the lost confidence and hope to complete the last longer and harder life with disabled body was suffering, too, I have to admit that, but in more precise analysis, this life game is never actually suspended as if a distinction can be draw out between that life before and this life now, after all, the Farewell won’t ever be said without your participation. Reading Kafka’s Castle, I was surprised to find a distant resonance in his description of K’s memories of climbing over the high wall around the cemetery with mine of climbing Celeste. The point is no sense for me: ‘no sense’ is the perfect answer to the problem like ‘what’s the sense of climbing the wall?’,’ what ‘s the sense of climbing the Mountain?’, or ’what is the sense of living?’. I believe that only a passing-by teacher and nobody else was watching K at that moment, whose glare explicitly reflected the meaninglessness while another bystander added the purified nonsense state would be blurred with his opinions. I have talked too much, this comment is written in English because of my wishes of its being read respectfully. Sorry for being late to finish Farewell and wish you a good life~",39032,english

[b]Pathologic 2 is a merger between psychological horror, Kafkaesque hoplessness, Futuristic Orwellian Dystopias sprinkled with a little bit of Lovecraft's ""from beyond"" Mythos.[/b]

Weather you love reading literature or not, this game is a depression and despair-inducing experience.

[b]STORY / LORE[/b]

Pathologic 2 takes place in one Artemy Burakh, the protagonist's, home town. Amid an apparently brutal war that is exhausting the country from resources they could dispatch to the town, Artemy is lucky to catch one of the very few trains that depart to this town.

As Burakh arrives on the town, after being summoned by his father with a letter, he is ambushed by locals mistaking him for a potential murderer. Artemy soon learns that his father and Simon Kain, two prominent elders, have been murdered on the day of his arrival. A manhunt ensues with several casualties and scapegoats occurring during the chaos of investigating for the murderer. Artemy is scapegoated by many, including the governor as the murderer of his father. This mania cools off the following two days as the dubious evidence against Burakh is slowly dismantled and his name is cleared amid a desperate need for someone to replace Burakh the Elder.


[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]

Pathologic 2 has no heavy emphasis on gameplay mechanics and the gameplay is a practical, simple and straight-to-business first person & inventory model.

You have several stat bars, a health bar, an exhaustion bar that determines how long you can remain awake before falling asleep (sleep cycles are 5 hours max), a hunger bar, a stamina/thirst bar and an immunity bar that if depleted you risk being infected by a particular disease, this disease is a one of the cores of the story and the game revolves around it.

You play in first-person. Several weapons ranging from lockpicks to revolves and shotguns are usable. There is an inventory system and in-game currency. You can rob people, loot, break into houses, pick locks, kill people and loot them (of their worldly possessions and their organs, flesh and blood). You can either navigate the town on-foot or use ""fingernail"" items which you can give to Kindred ones (NPC's) who will transport you on-boat to various locations around the town.


[b]Carpe Diem (Seize the Day) - Latin proverb[/b]

In Pathologic 2, you will very soon learn that the clock is [i]ticking[/i]. Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock. And if you don't make the best use of those ticks and tocks, you'll miss alot of events and errands and stuff and people to take care of, you'll find yourself in the worst possible place with the worst possible timing, as thus, the gameplay in Pathologic 2 can require [i]and[/i] teach you quite a bit about time-management and resource optimisation.

[b]PERFORMANCE AND VISUALS[/b]

Pathologic 2 has no heavy emphasis on visuals, the developers seem to be financially gated and can only produce so much. Despite this the game can have pretty spots on high graphics and has very good anti-aliasing, decent lighting and very high-quality faces to the NPC's and characters of the in-game world. The performance sometimes does leave something to be desired. My computer is running a GTX 1080Ti - Ryzen 5 1600x and 16GB of 3200Mhz RAM. The framerate hovers between 50-40 most of the game, but the funny thing is that if you enter a closed space such as a building, it will immediately dip to 30 and go below at occasions.


[b]Verdict: 9/10[/b]

Pathologic 2 is an extremely creative and unique setting with alot of attention, thought and innovation put into it and it's various details. The world crafting is on-point The game is a story-rich experience that at times makes you want to just gauge your eyes out from the desperation, as no matter how hard you try to save people and unravel mysteries and visit people you care for, [b]in the end you can't save everyone.[/b]",6814,english

0,steam_reviews/505230_Pathologic2.json,8293,13,"Don't mind the playtime. I've spent 100+ hours on this gem on Microsoft Store and bought it again on this sale because the game deserves it. 

I can start saying this has become one of my top 3 games ever after almost 15 years gaming actively. Other than that, I think it's like any good piece of art: When you try talking about it, you notice how useless it is to try and put into words; they lose meaning pretty quickly. 

I can only ask you to give this experience a try: 

-Fantastic storyline with unprecedented depth and mystery. 
-The feeling of being in a living russian tale where, in true kafkaesque fashion, the absurd is transformed into commonplace, which is uniquely terrifying. You never understand what's up with this world or its people, and in an attempt of understanding it you almost go crazy with them. 
-The fact that you're always miserable and almost dying gives an urgency that you will not find in any other game. You will be rewarded by your resourcefulness, and being smart when trading and exploring.
-Time is precious and you're forced to think twice before just going on a stroll through the city. You have to have a plan, which is absolutely terrifying when there's no right place to go or right thing to do. You're truly on your own while multiple different conflicts are getting progressively worse and more tense with no real solution in sight for any of them. 
-There is a deeply tribal/spiritual vibe to lots of themes in the game. It overlaps the two and feels like a fever dream many times.
-The game is full to the brim with beautiful symbolism and esoteric themes that are very rich and original, you can't really trace (at least I can't) the inspirations for the philosophical and metaphysical ideas presented which opens a completely subjective and personal interpretation; a real trip. Expect to ask yourself a lot of things. 

What is the Polyhedron after all? Is this city doomed? How could things get so bad so quick? Do you actually have agency or is fate inevitable? Is this story an opportunity for your character or an example of absolute absence of opportunity? Is civilization and nature ultimately incompatible? How much can we expect to disregard nature until it repays us for our stubbornness? Is it even capable of doing such a thing, or is our ignorance our self-destruction? Are the native people's occult-esque forebodings a true explanation of what's happening or is it just symbolic nonsense? But what is real in such a screwed up world where nothing really makes sense? 

These are a few of the many questions the game will throw at you. Even though I developed a deeply personal connection with what I took from it all, you really won't be able to give a compelling answer: Just like in life, you live it, understanding it perfectly or not. You may get to the end of it, see the outcome of your actions, and still be riddled as to what it all meant. Was there an overarching explanation or lesson to be learned? Is there a metaphor to be found? Maybe. But you can be sure of one thing: you've experienced a lot.",960,english
0,steam_reviews/505230_Pathologic2.json,8293,13,"Pathologic 2 manages to be both a remake and a successor to the cult-classic Pathologic 1.

Let me say right from the start that the game is a stellar achievement of what passion and vision can do. Pathologic 2 is a survival adventure which pushes the limits of how videogames can provoke your thoughts and emotions. Sure, many games make you feel uneasy or frustrated or curios or vexed, but Pathologic manages to subdue all of these feelings within it's gameplay framework, while also offering more. Once the days start going in-game, you will understand the gravity and sacrifices you need to do to move on, survive, and save others. Many times this survival will come at odds with other people's lives: do you give that last batch of antibiotics to the kid or keep it for whatever tomorrow has in store?Choices are what makes this game, reflecting real life dilemmas about ethics, philosophy and language.

The cast of characters returns from Pathologic 1 with some nice twists; the story is both similar to the Classic Haruspex route, while also serving a lot of fresh meat via the new, well-thought plague/treatment mechanics and improved bartering. It also has a improved UI, sound design (with the minor exception of OST which may or not have the same vibe) and a very distinct graphical style, having a mayakovskian atmosphere glooming over the utopian city. 

I believe it manages to take what was great about the first game and make it better without repeating or reusing the tropes and styles of the first game. It's a wonderful duality, which is why I recommend anyone interested to pick up and play either (or both). From my experience, the best is to play Pathologic 1's Bachelor route (for best intro, story and accomodation) and then ""upgrading"" to what Pathologic 2 has to offer in a wider sense: the Haruspex path. 

In either way, for fans of the series: YES this is another strike which will be known for years to come; it manages to both reiterate and refresh, bringing almost a totally new experience to fans

For new entries: YES, this is a game somehow more managable than the first; but understand: this is NOT your regular game, this is something else. If you will try to play it as another survival and hoard items and min-max, you WILL be punished.

Pathologic 2, as well as the Classic version, manage to do something unique: it makes you realize that games can achieve art-status as a Tarkovksy movie or a Kafka book. (in a way, these two are clear influences for Pathologic).  The way it breaks the fourth wall for gaming as a medium is offering a beyond-gaming experience: You will be haunted by the thoughts and images this experiences leaves you with; there is nothing quite like it known to man. You will love it or hate it; probably both and beyond",2857,english

[b]Yet it can still be very good.[/b]
tl;dr if you don't know what an allegory is, don't buy this game. Gameplay is interesting, but clunky and too easily abused. Atmosphere, concept, and story are wonderful - don't let the pretentious locusts buzzing about knock it.

It has some very, very interesting ideas regarding player choice - rather than ""do you want A or do you want B?"" the game simply allows you to manage your time, and most of its systems involve you doing that. Very organic choices and progression come out of this, and consequences as such don't feel terribly arbitrary. Penalties on death that are tethered to a given suite of saves is a stellar idea, if not for some problems:

Most of your deaths are going to come from learning the game's unexplained mechanics. Tilt your camera a little bit and get grazed in the wrong spot and you've dropped dead. You can die in your sleep. Your character has a bad habit of turning away from the thing he's supposed to punch. Two guys with knives will drain your blood if you've no bullets to pepper them - well, assuming the gun doesn't jam. Croaking from empty bars because you didn't yet learn that the strong tinctures reduce your hunger and exhaustion. This is all good. Except that you can just mash the escape button and load to an earlier save once it becomes clear you're about to get another death. 

The ability to hop back to earlier saves seems curiously at odds with the idea of punishing players for death, and requires you to specifically avoid doing if you can so help it - which will lead to your first run being a complete dumpsterfire of a thousand cuts. I bring this all up because this game isn't really hard once you realize this. Manage your finances, learn the economy, learn to prioritize what supplies you need, view your health as a resource, and save whenever you're chased by 4+ enemies because you were in the wrong neighborhood.

The core gameplay concept works just fine - manage your supplies to survive as well as to tend to the sick. For a while. Problem is, there's a -lot- of ideas they threw into the game that I never felt the need to make use of at the developer-intended difficulty. Micromanaging reputation? Brewing your own painkillers and antibiotics? Healing a bunch of random no-names to juice up a potential reward? Pilfering plagued houses? I never found myself needing to do these things. Survival on the whole becomes something of a joke in the latter half of the game: I wasn't playing particularly intelligently and yet found myself awash in resources and wanting nothing. 

 They really should have futzed around with the act of reloading earlier saves giving you negative penalties. Take the time to learn what a patient needs to get better? Great! Just reload to before you used those resources, and save yourself some resources with no penalty! It's easy to choose not to reload for something minor, yet when you hear COME OVER ERE five times in a row, you'd be a fool not to reload. Infection itself is utterly impossible to cope with, so you just reload to an earlier save if you do get it.

Outside of the gameplay (and performance issues, but whatever), it's fantastic. If you're someone who cannot form an independent thought of your own without some fat long-winded losers on youtube telling you how to feel, please don't get this game. I know that they've maybe read a few wikipedia articles for Russian literature and they spent so long on editing, but you're missing absolutely everything in the narrative if you're going into it with someone else's ideas rolling around. 

The game is drenched in metaphor, analogy, allegory, and completely abstract concepts. It is incredibly rewarding and incredibly well-realized if you go in as blind as you can, experience everything as it comes, and you think completely on your own as to the wider meanings of particular characters, coincidences, events, and so-on. The game's real difficulty is in chewing meaningfully on everything it indirectly explores - take to heart that wide wide concept of interconnection when you're chewing on any given particular idea. Actually knowing history adds to the task's difficulty. 

If you pick up the game and you think it's just some big allusion to WW2 or the USSR or some other banal thing you read about for half a week in a highschool history course, please abort that oversimplification and don't pollute the already-rancid community of people that like this game. I assure you, even if you made a 3-hour monologue about how good your farts smell, this game's impact is something that is pointless if it is not utterly personal and drawn from your own, organic responses both to the circumstances and to its provocations - and there's enough flatulators going on about their dumb takes on this game as-is.

It is a work of art - a tedious work of art. Yet I'm quite a fan of Kafka, which is no less arduous and annoying to claw through. The game's got layers, folks - if you're taking it at face value, you're playing the wrong game.",3019,english
0,steam_reviews/505230_Pathologic2.json,8293,13,"[h1]""Such is our town. You know it yourself: It's a very good village. Beautiful people live here, infusing it with a very spiritual dream. There's no real, villainous crime here. Even the rats and the thieves are softer.""[/h1]

Certain stories are so deep and strange that you just can't get them off your mind. When I played Yume Nikki as a teenager, I waited with baited breath every day to get off school and reenter that world of dreams. I've watched movies like Jacob's Ladder, Possession, and The Master many times each, trying to peel back their layers of mystery. Books like The Ark Sakura by Kobo Abe, Unclay by T.F. Powys, The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, and Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews have kept my eyes stapled to the page in wonder, dying to know what happens next. As I get older, fewer and fewer things manage to provoke this level of awe in me. So, I'm grateful Pathologic 2 summoned those feelings in me once again.

This isn't a game you can multitask-- there is no podcast that's appropriate to listen to in the background, no movie you can play in another window and commit half your attention to. Pathologic demands your full attention, so you can concentrate on the beautiful poetry of the dialogue (when a character informs you that they've ""been to the river, spoken with the Changeling, seen the soldiers in the fog,"" my mind went to W.H. Auden, T.S. Eliot, and Dylan Thomas) bathe in the immersive atmosphere, and fully acquaint yourself with the many empathetically-sketched characters. Everyone will walk away from this game with a favorite character. For some it will be Murky, the lovable orphan girl, for some it'll be Daniil Dankovsky, the effete, cosmopolitan physician, for some it'll be gravel-hearted Lara Ravel, the prickly and beautiful childhood companion who dreams of establishing a sanctuary for the sick. But, whoever your favorite ends up being, you'll know it when it happens, even if you never could've predicted that it was going to be them. I like Murky, Lara, Aspity, Oyun, and Aglaya. This game has fantastic writing, in both its dialogue and its plot beats/quests, and the abundance of good words to read will, in the end, make you feel as if you've read some lost masterpiece by Kafka, Dostoevsky, or Bulgakov.

Culturally, this game is steeped in Russian literature and history, and admirers of the aforementioned authors will feel at home in its pessimism, melancholy, surrealism, and wry humor. Visually, it seems to take from the films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Aleksei German, those great Soviet-era film directors who looked at Russia's blasted landscapes and depopulated industrial zones and imagined a science-fictional world of the spirit, a psychic place where man constantly dreams and dreams again of a society better than all the ones we've managed to devise so far. You don't need a familiarity with Russian art and culture to play this game, but if you have a working knowledge of it, you'll be amazed at the way it continues and expands the work of those great artists of the past.

Something that particularly amazed me was the story it told of an indigenous man, Artemy Burakh, half white and half native to the Siberian steppe (or, rather, native to a thinly veiled composite of several indigenous Northeast Asian racial groups-- the Kin are a fictional tribe, but they are very believable, and closely modeled after real groups from Siberia and Mongolia). The white denizens of the Town fight for Artemy's allegiant soul, and the steppe-dwelling Kin do as well. The whites see him as a native man, and the Kin sees him as a prodigal son, a man aspiring to whiteness. His speech is peppered with the language of his indigenous heritage, and yet fewer and vanishingly fewer of those he speaks to can understand those words. I have never seen a smarter or more subtle depiction of race and colonialism in a videogame.

And, of course, there is the disease pandemic, the ""sand plague,"" as it's called in P2. Astoundingly, P2 was released mere months before the COVID-19 outbreak, and it's eerily prescient of the trials we face now. In P2, uninfected citizens will assure you that the sick aren't worth treating, since they're essentially already dead. This is a horrible reflection of our own world, where the elderly and infirm are used as bartering chips for our economies, where the most vulnerable among us are encouraged to lay their lives on the line to give money to corporations and to grease the wheels of finance. Let the old folks go to the Applebee's, they say-- Applebee's needs the money, and if the old folks die, it was their time.

This game was an independent production and has a few gameplay janks and quirks. Others have noted its poor optimization, and, indeed, its performance was choppy on my computer, stuttering and chugging along basically every time I played. That I stuck with it is a credit to its quality in other areas. Another flaw that I haven't seen others complaining about is its undercooked day/night system, which is a little unsophisticated and can cause storytelling and immersion problems. Many quests become unavailable at midnight, and while the pressure to start and finish quests in a timely manner usually added wonderful layers of suspense, on at least one occasion I would start a quest 11:30pm, get halfway through it, and then watch helplessly as all the relevant NPCs vanished around me as the clock struck twelve, rendering the quest unfinishable. This is probably the biggest complaint I can file against Pathologic 2, and since it's a complaint that will ultimately encourage me to happily replay the game, I can't call it a major problem.

This is a smart and uncondescending game. It will not hold your hand or tell you how to win. It expects you use your mind and your creativity. If you do, you'll be rewarded.  It is deep, immersive, emotional, and will stick with you for a long time.",5438,english

0,steam_reviews/505230_Pathologic2.json,8293,13,"In my opinion, this game is a masterpiece and possibly one of the best video games ever made.  

It isn't for everyone, it follows a game structure that is diametrically opposite of current game making philosophy.  It won't hold your hand (albeit there are some amenities added that make it much easier to approach than Pathologic 1), you are not a superhero and you do not have time on your side.   It may seem daunting and potentially tedious at a glance but from my experience with the game, it ended up being quite compelling and exciting.  I actually had a lot of fun. 

To quickly sum up what the game is: It's a first person, open world horror sim with heavy emphasis on survival and choice/consequence that spans the course of 12 days. Your adversary: an almost sentient plague. Your goal: find a cure... and live.  There are tasks and quests doled out all over the place but time is constantly moving  so you have to decide what to do (or don't do), which includes weighing taking care of yourself or taking care of others.   The graphics are pretty good which is amplified by amazing lighting and absolutely phenomenal art style.  The sound design is pretty top notch and the music is just friggin' amazing.  The sounds and sights are very dour but really instil a sickening sense of dread and urgency.  Also it is crazy surreal...  very Kafkaesque or something David Lynch would approve of. 

I was hooked, every time I survived a day (usually by the skin of my teeth), I just kept feeling the urge to just keep pushing forward.  As the days went by, surviving each one was  bittersweet but satisfying because you're one day forward closer to the end. The system the developers devised is surprisingly compelling; there's this beautiful open town with lots to see and do but no time to do most of it. Honestly if you're too easily distracted or stopping too much to smell the roses... you will die.  The sense of urgency is dire, do you spend time running an errand for some  rich dude or do you help a friend, or do you do neither and just help yourself?  Potentially this game could be a character study of you.   Speaking of which, I beat this game on the intended difficulty,  without once having a firearm of any sort in my inventory and had never once mugged or murdered an innocent person... though I did when, desperate, broke into someone's apartment but I only took food (it's burglary, different than mugging).  I did kill but it was only the night time stalkers, sure they're people too but really shitty ones, so they got a free pass to hell.  There are no wrong answers in this game, just results and consequences.  In the end the best decisions are the ones that carry your character to the next day.  

I think this game is severely underrated but at the same time I can understand why other players were turned off by the staunch survival mechanics and the fact that you can't play at your own pace.  It's not a power fantasy, hell it's debatable if the character you play is really all that important.  Your a piece in play in that world and your actions may have some or little to no effect on it.  I think if your somebody who can push through it and accept that the odds are stacked against you, you'll find a wonderful story and an environment teaming with interesting characters and sights.

Some people who play the first half hour and give up may find the story to be incomprehensible or pretentious.  Fair enough.  The longer you play, the more things make sense.  It's like starting a book in the middle and unraveling the beginning and end at the same time. 

This is a game that is meant to be played again, and again, and again.  Each time you succeed and fail in different aspects, and the story changes accordingly.  You are fallible and weak, your choices are stupid.  All of them.  Yet you have to make them and keep going.  It's a game that forces you to adapt to impossible situations and obstacles.

0,steam_reviews/521890_HelloNeighbor.json,11997,1,"Сюрреалистические игры — развлечение не для многих. Не для многих разработчиков. Творцам нужно интуитивное видение границы, за которой эстетически ценный абсурдизм переходит в глупое подражание с бессмысленными мистификациями. The Franz Kafka Videogame, Virginia — творения не идеальные, но от них не веет тем, что называется «дешёвка».

А вот от поделки отечественной компании Dynamic Pixels Hello Neighbor веет. Да ещё как.

Сосед из ада
История начинается очень бодро и перспективно: наш герой становится свидетелем какого-то нехорошего действа, к которому причастен его сосед. Если опустить (а это рекомендовано для половины произведений современной культуры) логику «А почему бы не позвонить в полицию?», то продолжение довольно интригующее: парень пробирается в чужой дом, дабы выяснить, что в своём подвале скрывает потенциальный преступник.

Но далее сюжет сворачивается в сюрреалистичный узел, распутывать который — отдельная забава для посетителей тематических форумов. Каждый новый уровень представляет собой проникновение героя в усовершенствованную обитель соседа. Когда и как он успел отгородить себя от мира высоченной стеной или построить ветвистую сеть железной дороги для вагонетки вокруг своего замка, — большой вопрос. Почему раз за разом мы прокрадываемся в эти архитектурные творения, чего мы там ищем и что же в конце концов натворил наш усатый негодяй, — всё это отличные поводы для спекуляций.

И не надейтесь, что концовка всё расставит по своим местам. Она, во-первых, наступает слишком неожиданно (прохождение займёт часа четыре), а во-вторых, только углубляет непонимание. Сразу и не веришь, что этот блеклый эпизод является финалом запутанной детективной истории. Вполне возможно, что у сценаристов есть однозначное видение сюжета и они могут объяснить каждую странную деталь повествования. Но мне, как рядовому пользователю, ни на секунду не захотелось пройти Hello Neighbor заново, чтобы, уже имея определённую информацию, проникнуть в тайны её истории. Почему-то они кажутся не имеющими разгадки мистификациями.

нтеллектуальный хардкор
Ведь с геймплеем та же проблема, что и сюжетом. Сначала ты увлечённо прокрадываешься по дому соседа в стелс-режиме, выискивая нужные предметы, отвлекая его внимание, разгадывая логичные загадки. Но чем дальше, тем хуже. Механика остаётся той же на протяжении всей игры: герой может брать вещи, кидать их, а также использовать некоторые из них. Свободно блуждающий по дому сосед разбавляет рутину краткими гонками. Многое тут напоминает современные хорроры вроде Alien: Isolation. Отвлечь внимание «твари» можно брошенным предметом, а прятки в шкафу и под кроватью сопровождаются пугающей дрожью экрана. Только вот из укрытия мы наблюдаем не жуткого монстра, а потешного усатого дядьку, который, поймав нас, не примется отгрызать голову или отрывать конечности — вас просто ждёт перезагрузка уровня.

Так всю игру мы и перемещаемся по локациям, выбирая не раздражающие противника пути и решая головоломки. В последних, собственно, и заключается геймплейная ценность Hello Neighbor. Ценность сомнительная, ведь логика, которой подчинены загадки, совершенно непрозрачна и мало кто осилит Hello Neighbor, не заглядывая на YouTube.

Например, над решёткой в случайной последовательности мигают четыре лампочки. Когда загораются все, путь открывается. В другой комнате мы обнаруживаем пушки, стреляющие теннисными мячами по четырём рычагам. Связь установлена, и теперь нужно лишь как-то заставить эти машины «замолчать». Логично было бы просто взять и опрокинуть их, сломать, но решение, которое предлагает игра, куда менее тривиально. Для того, чтобы зафиксировать рычаги, нужно возвести заграждение между ними и пушками. Но как это сделать? Конечно же, вырастив несколько деревьев прямо на полу! А этого как добиться? Очевидно же — нужно стащить граммофон из другой части дома и включить его в данной комнате. Под волшебную музыку на наших глазах раскинется чудесный сад…

Hello Neighbor — штука очень странная. Во всех аспектах: в сюжете, механике, визуальном дизайне. Стиль игры забавен и приятен: напряжённые звуковые эффекты и типичные хоррор-элементы любопытно резонируют с красочной графикой. Многие локации выполнены добротно, встречаются радующие глаз интерьеры.

Однако сюрреалистические претензии авторов, похоже, сыграли злую шутку, ибо многие участки уровней сделаны спустя рукава. Куча комнат не имеет мебели, сами предметы окружения постоянно повторяются, интерьеры не рассказывают историю. Они будто сколочены без всякой логики и смысла — в надежде на то, что более креативные пользователи сами усмотрят в них эту историю. Создаётся ощущение, будто создатели вдохновились The Beginner's Guide, решили сделать так же, но таланта не хватило. Если в последней пустота и неказистость локаций оправдана концептуально, то здесь она ощущается халтурой.

В отношении Hello Neighbor, к сожалению, больше хочется говорить о технической реализации, чем о всяких геймплейных особенностях. Игровой процесс пестрит разными шероховатостями, угловатостями и недоработками. Сумасшедшая физика, созданная Dynamic Pixels, просто непозволительна: то положенный на землю мяч катится до края уровня, то персонаж вдруг «оттолкнётся» от земли вешалкой и совершит десятиметровый прыжок. Стулья застревают в стенах, тарелки — в мячах, сосед — в чём угодно.

Пространственное совмещение двух материальных объектов сопровождается противным дребезжанием. В игре может пропасть звук, случиться «краш» или произойти ещё какое-нибудь неожиданное событие, которое можно было бы назвать весёлым, если бы перед нами не была финальная версия.

«Бета» обнаружила множественные баги. И даже их разработчики не потрудились исправить. «Правильная» последовательность решения головоломок легко обходится во многих местах: например, герой может достать предмет из-за решётки, используя корявую физическую модель, или в определённых местах пройти сквозь стену.

Искусственный интеллект единственного в игре противника сделан неплохо, но не более того. Да, наш соседушка способен на многое: расставляет капканы под окнами, заботится о работе электричества, реагирует на источники шума. Завидев нас, начнёт погоню, во время которой будет бросать в нас замедляющие главного героя предметы.

Однако обмануть мерзавца ничего не стоит. И нет необходимости использовать предназначенные для этого разработчиками варианты вроде посиделок в шкафах. Приноровившись, можно забыть про весь этот стелс с гусиной ходьбой и незаметным проникновением — наш оппонент зачастую выбирает далеко не идеальные траектории, преодолевать некоторые препятствия он в принципе не способен, а нередкие «застревания» болвана в текстурах вообще могут лишить прохождение уровня какой-либо опасности.

Hello Neighbor — плод довольно странной идеи создать сюрреалистический стелс-хоррор. Саму по себе её сложно назвать удачной. Решение пазлов, не имеющих очевидных логических связей, придётся по душе лишь представителям очень редкой интеллектуальной субкультуры. Это игра на любителя — любителя изучать каждый пиксель уровня, разгадывать недоступные обычному человеческому уму загадки и радоваться неожиданным фокусам программного кода.

Плюсы: приятный визуальный стиль; иногда гонки с соседом вызывают эмоции.

Минусы: загадочный, философичный сюжет; краткость кампании; скупой геймплей, копирующий штампы современных хорроров; обилие «квестов» из серии «Посмотри, что надо делать, на YouTube»; море багов.

0,steam_reviews/524220_NieRAutomata.json,117490,1,"I don't usually write review (never in fact) but here I felt like I had to, even if I'm very late in doing so. I don't know if I'll add more to what's already being said, this game's out for a long time now, but nevertheless here I go.

Without spoilers, the story is beautiful and well-written, the tracks are just... wow, the graphics are good and I liked the philosophical references throughout the game and the message it tries to convey. You know what they say ""Came for 2B's a**, stay for the story""

For the graphics and the performance I must say I will not trash talk them. Why ? Because, I didn't encounter any real performance problem (is it my computer ?) nor were the graphics that bad in my opinon even with medium-low ones. Yes, there was a lag at each (each ? don't remember) start of the game but it didn't bother me as I thought that it was so because it had to load the textures and so on. In my case FAR didn't drastically change everything (Did I skipped something ?)

And finally, the playability. I must say, it was my first time ever playing with a controller (I don't play games that much) and so it will not surprise you that I had a hard time playing at the start. I think, it is one of the reason why I had to restart the prologue (up to the first boss) like more than five times. But eventually, I got a hold of the controls and I'm very happy I did't stop because of that.

All and all, I think that Nier:Automata is closer to a visual novel than it is to a game and in this sense I recognize it is not for everybody. 10/10.

SPOILER ALERT :












Well, what can I say.
Story-wise, as I said, I think the story is beautiful, and the reason for that being that the tragic of the story is perfect.
A tragic situation must be some kind of turning point in the story of someone. And this story is just that. Be it the fact that 2B had to kill 9S again and again, or the death of 2B by the hand of A2 for exemple, here you have two perfect exemples of tragic situations, the latter marking the start of 9S's descent into madness. And speaking of 9S, this madness of his was just... wow. Slowly unraveling the truth of his world while being tormented, just to end it meaninglessly in a fight against A2.. It was like all of the story was meant to end here. It was like all was leading to this one moment. It was like, it must end here and nowhere else, it couldn't be otherwise. And I think that it shares similarities with Kafka's book ""The trial"" in this sense : It is a meaningless story.
I think ""slow"" is a key-word in this piece of art. Because the story builds-up slowly. I saw somewhere a comment saying that ""route A was the end of the tutorial"" and I cannot less agree on that. This first Act was like the introduction. It helps you discover the characters, their personnality and reasoning. (btw I very much liked route B and 9S point of view was good to see)
Moreover, I loved the philosophical references throughout the game. Heck, I laughed when I saw Jean-Paul and being interested in philosophy I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

The music. The music is absolutely fabulous and well-adapted to the scene they are incorporated into. They're obviously all top notch, but I think three favourites of mine are The weight of the world, City Ruins and Amusment Park. For Amusment park, it really felt like I was in a real one with all of the clown dancing around (and I regretted killing them when I had to ;w;). They contributed a lot to the general atmosphere of sadness (or calmness) and when walking in the ruins, I was like ""I could just walk here aimlessely forever and just listen to the music"". Finally, concerning The weight of the world, I don't know how many times I played it and cried when earing it.

For the controls and weapons, it was very nonexistent in my exprience in the sense that I just smashed two buttons and maybe used one combination but that was it. Moreover, I didn't used the weapons that were offered by the marchants (I bought them for maxing them) and only used the first two weapons for 2B (the default). For 9S I made him use the ""control spear"" when I acquired it. (don't remeber its name, the one that have a chance to control an ennemy). 
But the fact that this part of the gameplay was not so much pushed forward didn't bother me (Like, hell you have the strongest weapon at the start of the game if I'm not wrong). In fact, when I realised that one weapon was sufficient, I didn't care about it anymore. I was attracted by the story and not so much by the ""technical"" aspect of things.


In conclusion, I'd like to say that even if this game is not for everybody, I encourage people to at least try it. The story is beautiful and made me cry numerous times. And even if I was spoiled a little (the fact the humans were all dead, thanks youtube), it didn't stop me from playing. On the contrary, it made me even more courious about the how and why. 
And all of this is why I prefer using the term ""visual novel"" for this game. The story is what's important here and when playing, I felt like I was seeing a play unfold itself.",4982,english

Gregor's transformation, familial-shunning and eventual death (spoilers) were minor problems compared to attempting to play as a cockroach with a trackpad on this game. The character models are as removed from the human-forms as cockroaches themselves, the woman's piercing stare an embodiment of the uncanny-valley, and her bizarrely prominent bust doing little to assuage my unease. As for the male character model, describing the horror that his appearance elicits extends far beyond my command of the English language. The community is dead, except for children who were doubtless bought this game as a punishment, and people from other countries (no thanks).

Graphically, the handrawn art style is full of charm and is very easy on the eye.

0,steam_reviews/550990_ViktoraSteampunkAdventure.json,58,3,"Viktor, a Steampunk Adventure is a classic point-and-click adventure game set in a dystopian animal-people world ruled by a cruel and incompetent Emperor, who seems to be more interested in engaging in yet another war, rather than taking care of his people. The protagonist, a wild boar, had enough with Emperors incompetent ways and sets on a quest to overthrow him.

The game doesn’t take itself too seriously: it’s wacky, it’s totally dumb, its humor is mostly based on how actually not funny it is (think fart jokes with Nicola Tesla) and despite getting nearly everything wrong it still manages to be somewhat enjoyable.

The main spotlight of the game is Viktor. He’s not your typical protagonist: he is rude, he has anger issues (indeed, next to the classical talk, take and describe buttons there is a kick button to relieve the anger) and seems to be the type of people who are completely incompetent at anything yet think they are the best fit for the job, especially if it’s a commanding job. Despite all of this, he is extremely liberal and criticizes the Emperor for not ensuring women have equal rights. I know game creators were going for not-two-dimensional character, but Viktor being a liberal just seems out of character and forced. I think it was a great idea to take such an antihero as a main character, but it’s not executed well: these traits don’t really add anything to the story itself or complicate the journey in any way.

Other characters in the game are extremely primitive. Even the ones based on famous real life (or fiction) people like Franz Kafka, Frankenstein, Nicola Tesla, Dr. Jekyll don’t have much character. The game introduces them, gives them few lines and you’re done with them forever. They do not contribute to the story in any way and are there just for the sake of it.

The game also has a love story. Viktor falls in love with a totally flat zebra character. Needless to say, there is zero chemistry between them, they only shared like couple lines of dialogue together and are suddenly in love because they were on some love roller coaster with decapitated toy panda head. The only thing this love story gives to the game or the story is how out of place it is. With everything being out of place and at random, it’s like a cherry on top of the absurd dumbness.

The story seems to be written by a five year old, but I suppose that was actually the goal here. There is nothing much to say about it, Viktor goes on adventure to overthrow the Emperor, gets his ass kicked, but then meets some anarcho-communists who want Emperor dead as well. Together they develop a plan and on their way they need to complete few tasks, like find money to fund the revolution or how to overcome the powerful electrical force field protecting the Emperor. All the situations are absurd driven and rely heavily on black humor to make it work. The humor is something I could appreciate. While it is as lame as it gets, that is what actually gets it going. It definitely falls into a category “so bad it’s good”. I wouldn’t call it great, but I had few good laughs on my way to the final boss.

While good gameplay and puzzles could make everything else work and even make it a perfect self-ironical-game, it is sadly the weakest point of the steampunk adventure. At it’s core it is your typical point-and-click where you can interact with characters and items around you with few rather small innovations. One of them is the mentioned kick button next to the usual talk, take and describe. The other is your ability to call your your psychic sidekick owl for hints. While this sounds like a good idea to help you when you’re stuck it is actually essential to call him, otherwise nothing would make sense. Not that it does when the owl vaguely explains what to pay attention to, but without his advice you would be totally clueless and would rely on just trying out everything until something works. I found it cheap. Rather than making an environment and puzzles interact with each other to make sense, we need an owl to give some context of what is going on.

Another, rather frustrating, thing is that the game requires you to take certain actions before you can do other things. I’ve particularly noticed this at the end of the game, where two items I knew I needed were inactive until I’ve basically tried everything else, even the things I knew would get me nowhere!

There were few decent puzzles at the game, the best of them being at Frankenstein’s lair, where you need to solve a complex task to eventually get the item you need. However mostly the puzzles are picking correct threads of dialogue bubbles, which in my opinion are not puzzles or even much of a game for that matter. Most stages consist of no more than two rooms you can go to, so there is not much to explore or to get stuck at, so the game is pretty easy.
There are also mini games and I’m usually not a fan of those at all. This time it was no different, I was hoping I could get them in the first try just to get them out of the way. They are easy enough not to bother you, but there is no point in them either.

What really stands out is animation. The game is set in the authoritarian world, much like Soviet Union, and the style is something of the 80’s soviet cartoons. Growing up in post Soviet country, I found the style to capture the mood and atmosphere perfectly. Everything is drawn beautifully with fine details and fits well with absurd dystopian world.

The music is not originally composed for the game and instead uses classical compositions that you can change at any moment as Viktor happens to carry a record player with him. I wouldn’t call lack of original soundtrack a flaw since the music fits quite well with the game, it is not annoying and knowing that the game probably had very small budged, I think creators found a perfect solution. The dialogue bubbles are accompanied with simple mumbling which is different for every character, and that gets annoying quickly. First of all, there is a lot of dialog in the game so you hear the mumbling all the time. That wouldn’t be so bad, actually that alone would be better than just silence, but the mumbling doesn’t fit the text! The tone and the length usually do not match, which is very distracting. For example Viktor, being a rude boar, is usually yelling in the text bubble, but his mumbling is calm and slow.

Surprisingly the game is not as terrible as it might seem. I actually enjoyed playing it and even wanted to finish it. It’s about five hours of gameplay, of what should have been two to three hours maximum. That way it could have been a neat little adventure with unique style and over the top story telling. As it is now, it requires too much time in exchange of how little it delivers. I would only recommend it if you particularly enjoy over the top movies and intentionally lame comedy is your cup of tea and you have nothing better to do for five hours. I just barely give it thumbs up.",343,english

https://youtu.be/IRpX2EEHwl8

The story is set in a 'steampunk' era with dirigibles, lever-operated machinery and suchlike. You play as Viktor, a tusked boar wearing a raincoat, who decides he wants to become Emperor of Austria/Hungary for some reason. He travels from scene to scene, each of which has several characters to chat with, and various puzzles to find and solve in order to progress to the next scene. Pretty standard gameplay for this genre.

There's a huge number of dialogs as you chat to each character in each scene. There are usually several options for each character, and each time you solve a puzzle the dialog updates so you end up with tons of text to work through - you could create a full-on stage play with all this content. There's usually one option to activate something, and the others are just for fun. It never gets boring, I always click every option to enjoy all the great humour (including plenty of poop jokes). When you find the world map (near the start) be sure to click on all the countries to see the descriptions, they're hilarious!

The puzzles are excellent. Lots of minigames and item pickups to be used on other objects to produce animations, as you would expect.

[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]

I love the pencil-drawn style and all the wonderful characters and objects all over the place. You can tell a lot of love and attention has gone into this. The screen resolution is rather flakey though - strange things were happening when I tried to run it in 1080p for my video on my 1200p monitor. I believe fullscreen will fill any screen, and you can ALT-ENTER for a window which is a decent size but not resizable - no in-game resolution options for the window either.

The chuckle-worthy ""goodbye bug"" that throws up a coding error every time you exit the game is a nice touch.

Music is well above average. You pick up CDs along the way so that your library increases and you can select whichever tune you like from an options menu. There's a wide variety including classical, opera and even heavy metal, so there's bound to be something to suit your taste. Sliders are available for music/effects volume control.

The gobbledygook language the characters use is just brilliant, it never gets old. The most wonderful thing about it is that even though it's nonsense, it nevertheless has a very distinctive accent that you would associate with the part of the world that Viktor is from.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

I've played some (too) difficult point-n-clickers in my time but for me this is perfect - I would say it's a solid medium difficulty. You do have to put some thought/dexterity into it but it never gets frustrating. If you ""look at"", ""chat with"", ""use"" or ""attack"" everything in sight and check your inventory for items to use on other objects, eventually something will happen. Meanwhile you have all kinds of interesting stuff to discover and dialog to read.

[h1]Steam[/h1]

Very nice achievements here. 16 of them, and most don't pop up unless you specifically strive for them. I like that. No trading cards, Windows-only and no Steam Cloud support.

[h1]Value[/h1]

Yesterday I reviewed The Franz Kafka Videogame which has a very similar concept. Although this costs $2 more, it's far better value in terms of both length and the density of content/puzzles crammed into it, and the achievements give it genuine replay value. I'd certainly be happy to pay full price for this.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

A game with great character, distinctive style, engaging storyline, plenty of humour and just an all-round joy to play. I'd like to play it on Linux please, dev :)

For years, I was aware of SB as a game with a unique art style, cool premise and very strong writing, but for some reason it never moved past that point on my radar. Now that I have, I can't really say that it's like any other game I'm aware of. Sure, you can say the conceit of the game-play is a nod to Majora's Mask and the bobble-headish exaggerated art-style is reminiscent of the Wonderful 101, but that says nothing about the actual tone or personality of this game. 

In terms of quality, 90% of this game's execution is spot-on, from the art and level design to the writing and music. The other 10% is fuddled by some awkwardness: from point-and-click-gone-wrong controls on PC (just give us the option to re-bind keys, it solves everything), UI covering elements in the screen that are necessary for progression, the ""stealth"" mechanic feeling like cheesing the game's own mechanics, some obtuseness about some of the game's basic mechanics (it took me about three-quarters of the game to realize I could start my day at a different clock). Even though I think SB is a very good game with the potential to be a really great game, these parts were not enjoyable and were often frustrating.

However, none of that changes the fact that my biggest issue with the game was that I wanted MORE. Not because SB is a slight experience or lacks a satisfying conclusion (and in fact I'm glad to play a game which is actually meant to be FINISHED within a few days rather than wasting my time in pursuit of chimeric ""content""). When I finished SB and collected every last scrap of tantalizing lore, I immediately felt like I wanted to start the game over again. I had become wrapped up in the feel of SB's gaudy, surrealist hallways, its secreted hidden passages, its overblown personality and surprising commitment to thematic storytelling. You can tell a game's writers put some serious thought into what they were doing when they create a whole library section filled with allusions that only make sense when you've finished the game. And yeah, if your game references Kafka I don't even care that I'm being pandered to, we're on the same vibe.

They say that german syntax makes Kafka’s gut turning wit solely German’s  own. In that same way, I wonder if Icey is really much better in Chinese , because in English it is too clumsy.

 What feels like maybe it should be a subtle, revisionist take on action games and an exploration of player choice, is instead a groan inducing romp. There are so many winks and nudges in the store description alone I could hardly believe it was trying to play the gimmick straight.

outside of the paper thin “mystery” subtext, (I bet this is just a regular action game where you follow the narrator wink wink) it’s a competent side scrolling action game. you can unlock moves, but none of it feels particularly engaging.

""The Land of Pain"" ist einer dieser Titel, bei dem es recht viel zu kritisieren gibt, sich aber auch gleichzeitig nicht als wirklich schlechtes Spiel entpuppt, was das Ganze zu einem ziemlich paradoxen Erlebnis macht. 

Zuallererst fällt natürlich auf, wie gut das Spiel im direkten Vergleich mit gleichwertigen Titeln aussieht. Dank der CryEngine werden Landschaften & Wälder großteils hervorragend präsentiert und die tolle Beleuchtung sorgt für eine schaurig-schöne Atmosphäre. Atmosphärisch wirken auch der sich gut ins Setting einfügende Soundtrack und das Sounddesign, welches sich durchaus auf Augenhöhe mit einigen Titeln aus dem Hause Frictional Games bewegt. Top!

Sobald man die Wälder verlässt, schwächt sich dieser wirklich gute Ersteindruck jedoch deutlich ab, denn so toll wie die Außenbereiche auch aussehen mögen, so ganz können die Innenareale & die Assets da nicht mithalten. Vor allem die Indoor-Assets wie Möbel, Türen & Haushaltsgegenstände wirken teilweise doch recht grob und haben mich immer wieder an das technische Grundgerüst des knapp neun Jahre älteren ""The Dark Mod"" erinnert. 
Wie dem auch sei, das technische Gesamtkonstrukt bleibt trotzdem eine Wucht und ich finde es absolut beeindruckend, was der Entwickler hier auf die Beine gestellt hat. Ich ziehe meinen Hut vor Alessandro Guzzo, denn solch ein Projekt solo zu realisieren erfordert sehr viel Talent, Planung & Sitzfleisch.

The Land of Pain spielt sich im Großen und Ganzen deckungsgleich mit den vielen, vielen anderen First-Person Adventures, die auf Steam oder itch.io verfügbar sind und zeigt deutliche Parallelen zu einigen Walking Simulator Games da draußen, was ja per se erstmal nichts schlechtes heißen muss, da in Spielen derlei Art meiner Meinung nach oft viel Potential steckt. Ein Potential, dass The Land of Pain nicht ganz ausschöpft, das Spiel schafft es aber trotzdem, eine großteils gute, fast schon kafkaeske Atmosphäre zu erzeugen. Man fragt sich ständig, was wohl passieren wird, wenn ich dieses Haus oder oder die Höhle da betrete oder was mich hinter der nächsten Anhöhe erwarten wird. Im Großen und Ganzen ist dieser Teil des Spiels sehr gut gelungen.

In klassischer Adventure-Manier wollen dabei Aufgaben erfüllt & Probleme gelöst werden, das Rätseldesign beschränkt sich jedoch hauptsächlich auf das Finden von Gegenständen, die dann wiederum irgendwo eingesetzt oder ""verbraucht"" werden können, was aber auch bedeutet, dass man durchaus mal mit der berühmt-berüchtigten ""Adventure-Logik"", also das spezifische Lösen von Problemen in einer bestimmten Reihenfolge, konfrontiert werden kann, was, trotz einer Hilfefunktion, für Frustmomente und nervige Laufwege sorgen kann. Besonders hier greift meiner Meinung nach wieder der Umstand, dass man im Hinterkopf behalten sollte, dass es sich hier um ein Ein-Mann-Projekt handelt und dafür geht das Rätseldesign dann doch wieder mehr oder weniger in Ordnung, obwohl es unbestritten sein sollte, dass hier Verbesserungspotential besteht. 

Es wird relativ viel gelaufen, die Areale sind meistens weitläufig designt worden und auch das ein oder andere belanglose Secret lässt sich entdecken, nur hätte ich mir persönlich doch etwas mehr Abwechslung gewünscht. Irgendwann hatte ich mich nämlich an den ganzen Wäldern & Höhlen sattgesehen und auch die gefühlt siebte gruselig beleuchtete Cthulhu-Büste konnte mich nicht mehr schocken. So schön die Spielwelt auch sein mag, ich kann mich nicht wirklich an einen richtigen ""Wow-Moment"" erinnern, der mir prägend im Gedächtnis geblieben ist, weil alles irgendwann ineinander überzugehen zu scheint. Für ein Ein-Mann-Projekt ist das Kritik auf hohem Niveau, das ist mir bewusst und doch sollte man The Land of Pain einmal selber erlebt haben, um zu verstehen, dass wirklich viel Wald in diesem Spiel steckt. 

So gar nicht gefallen hat mir dagegen das Monster. Das Monster spielt keine wirklich zentrale Rolle, es erfüllt aber seinen Zweck und es gibt ein, zwei spannende Verfolgungsjagden, nur ist es in den restlichen Auftritten, welches es hat, so nervig, dass man sich wünscht, es nie wieder sehen zu müssen. Simples weglaufen wäre an sich ok, vergleichbare Spiele präsentieren ihr Monster auch nicht anders, nur ist hier so, dass das Viech ab und zu in der Nähe oder direkt vor der Spielfigur spawnt, was meistens einen Instadeath nach sich zieht. Abseits davon ist das Monster überhaupt nicht interessant und mir erschließt sich nicht ganz, inwiefern sich solch ein blödes Hui Buh Gespenst in das Lovecraft-Setting einfügen soll. 

Apropos Lovecraft-Setting: Das Setting geht an sich in Ordnung und bringt eine Handvoll interessanter Ideen mit, nur sollte man nicht mit einer Blockbuster-Erwartungshaltung an das Spiel rangehen. Ein-Mann-Entwicklungen haben nun mal das Problem, dass sie oft keine wirklich durchdachte Story besitzen, einige wenige Vorzeigetitel mal ausgenommen. Der Entwickler gibt sich redlich Mühe, sein Setting und die Story dahinter so gut es geht zu präsentieren, dem Spiel fehlt es dann aber doch irgendwie an NPCs oder etwas Sprachausgabe. 

Auch das sich das Spiel Lovecraft auf die Fahne schreibt, wirkt eher wie ein Mittel zum Zweck. Ein glaubwürdiges Lovecraft-Setting zu entwickeln bedeutet halt mehr, als Ziggurats, Chtulhu & geheimnisvolle Gerätschaften in sein Spiel zu packen, etwas, was die Entwickler von ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", ""Darkest Dungeon"" & auch ""Darkwood"" verstanden haben und ich hier leider nicht wirklich wiederfinde, was dem Spiel insgesamt mehr schadet, als es Vorteile mit sich bringt. 

Wie eingehen bereits erwähnt, gibt es von meiner Seite her viel an The Land of Pain zu kritisieren. Wäre das Spiel von einem Entwicklerstudio + Publisher entwickelt & veröffentlicht worden, ich hätte einen Daumen nach unten vergeben. Da es sich hier aber um ein an sich grundehrliches Ein-Mann-Projekt für wenig Geld handelt, empfehle ich das Spiel weiter. Im Sale kann man The Land of Pain durchaus mal mitnehmen und jetzt zu Halloween ist eh der richtige Zeitpunkt für derlei Spiele gekommen. 

Für die Zukunft bin ich gespannt, ob und inwiefern sich der Entwickler mit ""The Alien Cube"" weiterentwickelt hat.

0,steam_reviews/570_Dota2.json,1024921,2,"Without exaggeration or hyperbole, this might be the WORST DESIGNED game I've ever seen. Right from the drop, you're bombarded with an overwhelming amount of popups, broken links, roundabout interfaces, and nonsensical graphs that even navigating to the point where you're moving a character around feels like you've endured some dystopic Kafkaesque nightmare. The menus feel like they've been designed by a team of hyperactive five year-olds just out-shouting each other each one getting their own idea of what should be included as essential information to would-be players. It's honestly headache-inducing.

But then you start the game, and it gets even worse. There are constantly pings and popups, no clear design on what you're supposed to be doing or clicking, and what strategy that there supposedly IS to the game is hidden behind 60+ minute Youtube videos and is radically counterintuitive. I say this as someone who has spent literally THOUSANDS of hours playing other MOBAs. This game makes zero goddam sense. Battle starts, and sometimes you just get stunlocked and killed before the enemy team is even visible. And then the game just keeps dragging on, because apparently that's necessary.

Afterwards you're subjected to a litany of popups and buzzing animations, none of which make any sense.

The meta, from what I understand, discourages any form of creativity or deviance, and the game is loaded with options and available decisions that you are uniformly punished for availing yourself of.

Hopelessly convoluted, and loaded with design decisions so bad that it's downright aggressively confrontational. Honestly, it's astonishingly bad.",71,english

Apparently I dispatched a streamer back to the lobby and on their way out they selected a drop-down list option, the only one that could assuage their bruised ego, ""Stream Sniping""...

0,steam_reviews/582010_MonsterHunterWorld.json,375469,1,"[h1] Buckle up: This is going to be a long one [/h1]

This is one of those times I [i] really [/i] wish I could give a mixed review. There is good and bad in almost equal amount, but unfortunately it is not the good moments of this game that linger, nor do the frustrating ones fade. So it is important to note that this is not a wholly negative review as stated, more of a cautionary mixed fayre.

Firstly, there is a lot of good to be found here. The monsters of course, the main pull of the game, are rendered beautifully with flowing animations. Sometimes the monsters clip through terrain or do not line up correctly, but none of it is excessive, nor off-putting and is more of a limitation of the map size and tightly spaced areas you often end up fighting them in. The world design is very evocative of earlier games in the series and really gives you the impression of feeling very small in a world of giant creatures. The food in the game looks gorgeous and makes me hungry very time. There's an array of weapons that can suit anyone and until the later part of the game you feel very free in your options. The combat is reactive, punchy and feels incredibly satisfying. There is some limited skill to be involved in min-maxing combos, dodging and using items effectively but you can also bulldoze your way through quite a large portion of the game just by button mashing.

[u] So, what's the problem? [/u]
Well, it is not in the core of the game for sure. The core of the game is solid and hugely enjoyable. They made a fantastic game where you walk around with massive weapons and beat the crap out of ridiculously huge monsters, what's not to love? Well, turns out quite a lot. It is what wraps around the game. It is the trimmings. It is a gem of a game packaged in shattered hopes and dreams.

There are some frankly bizarre stylistic choices that are commonly found within eastern RPGs and MMORPGs. If you don't personally find this a negative, then feel free to ignore. But I feel I should point them out nonetheless.
Few of the characters are voiced. Though should be thankful of that. (More on this later) Those who are voiced are mostly fine, but nothing to write home about. Many of the voice acting can be recognised from other Japanese games.

[u] Then there's the aesthetics [/u] Well, many of the characters can be made to wear ridiculous outfits that stylistically don't match the game at all. You can make people wear giant cat fursuits. You can make the female characters wear...well as you can probably guess...not a whole lot (this is occasionally true for male characters too). Obviously, it doesn't take itself too seriously and that itself fine. You have little tiny cat creatures running around helping you on the battlefield, pushing toy-like emergency prams around because...reasons I guess? You may love this design choice. If you don't then then you may have a hard time pushing through the saccharine sweetness this game can shower you with. The main problem is that on first glance the game does not seem the sort to do this sort of design choice.

Then there's my biggest gripe. [b] The UI. Oh the UI [/b] How it pains me just thinking about it. I am honestly convinced they got a clinically insane individual to co-author on the design. It is as if Capcom tried to reinvent the wheel by making them square and then shaving down the corners in order to make them round again. It is mind-boggling. Layers and layers of menus. A Kafkaesque labyrinth that damns your soul for eternity if you cannot escape its clutches. You cannot even spam the same button through the fifty menus it takes to get into a game because there'll be that one sneaky decision that needs a different button prompt and suddenly you did something completely opposite what you wanted.

The UI is at its worst when it comes to co-op. Co-op should be the boon of this game, but it is what I hate about it most. It has definitely been designed with a co-op experience in mind and yet makes it so difficult. Here are just a few reasons:

- * -It takes several layers of menus to even find the option to join someone you are friends with within a story mission.
- * - Expeditions (free-from missions where you can go out to certain areas and hunt what you please) are even harder to set up, often involving going to the bottom of lists to find the name of the your friend in menus you would never even dream of looking in unless you knew they existed. Sometimes there are easier ways to get to the mission via invitation, but the game decides whether it wants to allow that or not.
- * - You often cannot join story missions together until you've seen some arbitrary cutscene that could be in the beginning, middle or end of a mission.
- * - You have to repeat these same steps for every mission or expedition even if you're technically 'connected' to a server instance of the other person.
- * - Intrusive tutorial pop-ups even after dozens of hours of playtime.
- * - Unintuitive keybindings for such important things as, oh I don't know, healing items. You can send out an emoji button easily though. Yay.
- * - The English localisation of text at times is left a lot to be desired. For example, I wanted to lower the music in the game and found that it was titled 'BGM volume' with the tooltip not even explaining what the hell 'BGM' even means. It means BackGround Music, so you know. I had to look it up.
- * - You cannot select an aesthetic skin over armour or weapons, at least not until late game and even then it is, of course, overly complex and headache inducing.
- * - Wearing matching armour is often hindering to your character. Note: Armour does often stack skill bonuses with the more parts you wear, but you'll be pressed to find any bonuses that aren't incredibly niche. You instead have to find armour pieces that suit your specific playstyle, which in of itself wouldn't be a problem without the aforementioned 'lack of skins' problem.
- * - The stun-locking and status affects monsters can dish out can be excessive and intensely frustrating. If I'm stunned for 10 seconds [i] and [/i] on fire how on earth am I supposed to heal? Healing does not make you invulnerable, by the way.
- * - The story is mindless, but I have no massive complaints of it as very few people are here for it and it seems to be happy to lumber along itself without you. Bar one exception, there are times you don't feel like you are the main character. Instead, [i] the handler [/i] a sickly violent overdose of happiness and assault on my mental health, manages to insert herself ever more into the centre frame. Her existence causes me great pain and her voice makes me want to rip my ears off and set them on fire.

[u] Individually [/u]  these things are like little paper cuts. All of these things collectively are like a death by a thousand cuts. I don't feel it after I while, but boy do I notice the blood loss. The moment I'm having fun with the game, it manages to wrestle the controller from me and proverbially beat me over the head with it.
I want to love this game and there are many times I do. But it is like a toxic relationship, the game equivalent of the 'over attached girlfriend' meme. Whenever I do love this game, I feel punished for it. Whenever I hate it, I inevitably forgive and go back.

If this sort of thing doesn't bother you and you can switch off your mind to the...bizarre concoctions this game has squirted out of itself, then you will find fun here. But I do think that fun should come with an advisory warning to ones sanity. If you get this on sale, certainly that makes some of the more egregious problems more palatable. If you come prepared and armoured for the problems ahead (and I didn't) then you may find it a game where you can, nay must, sink many hours into it. If you can bypass all these things. If this still sounds like a good time, then it most likely will be. If this is your jam, go for it.

0,steam_reviews/588230_Beckett.json,137,8,"Pretentious, overwrought fluff. Kafka and Lynch are apparent references, usually overbearingly so, but references to powerful art don't make for powerful art, just as poetic posing doesn't make for poetry. 

I'm very glad people are using gaming as a more general art medium, and it's worth pointing out some very good technical aspects to [I]Beckett[/I]. Despite its minimalism, there is a nice variety of multimedia interactions: textual presentations, sound clips, video art, 3D models, drawings, and good music. I found the music to be especially evocative. Honestly, I would much rather listen to the soundtrack than play this game.

The few good components, though, add up to an eye-roll-inducing whole. It's the text that brings the whole thing down: gooey with stylistic pomp, stapling together a melodramatic narrative that would be perfectly at home in a mediocre soap-opera. It's an indulgent mess that I couldn't click fast enough to get through.

Reading through reviews, it seems that many of you found this game to be deep and meaningful. I don't begrudge your experience, but I didn't have it.

Впечатления не однозначные.
Общее положительное впечатление и пару отличных катарсисных моментов портят / ломают некоторые крайне слабые моменты.
Но всё же скорее ""может быть"", да и отличный повод подкачать англицкий. [Перевода нет и не надо.]


Не понравилось:
Не люблю ситуацию когда называются громким / звучным именем знаковым и лепят отсебятину. 
И в этом смысле Beckett, конечно не такой понос как The Franz Kafka Videogame, но и путь которым пошла Californium мне гораздо симпатичней. [Ни в названии, да и в самой игре имя знаменитого писателя практически не упоминается, что развязывает авторам руки в плане допущения вольностей.]

Самого Беккета я, почему то, всегда мысленно соизмеряю с Кафкой и ирландец всегда проигрывает. 
Вся эта ""любовь"" к насекомым - ну Вы меня понимаете... И говорить не о чём... Понятно откуда ноги растут...

Первое что бросается в глаза и раздражает - это top down расположение камеры. Вроде и местности чаще выполнены очень хорошо но в общем выходит как то деревянно. К слову местами камеру расположили под небольшим углом и всё ожило и заиграло какими то красками.

В первой половине игры фотография гг мне кране напоминает Чикатило и от этих ассоциаций я никак не могу отделаться...

Нарисованные истории, выполнены хорошо но выпадают из общей стилистической парадигмы, про смысловое наполнение вообще промолчу - совсем слабое.

Местами слабые и тривиальные фотографии фоновые.

Современная дискотека, современные мусорные баки, чернокожая девушка и мобильный телефон - просто выбивают из колеи и всё рушат / гoвняют атмосферу. 
И после таких ходов и откровенно слабейшей и тривиальнейшей концовки был счастлив прочесть: BECKET IS NO MORE и выдохнуть.


Понравилось:
Общая атмосфера хороша в своей гнусности.

Озвучка окружения просто замечательная, очень атмосферная.

Музыка хорошая, атмосферная.

Парочка хороших катарсисных моментов.

Парочка хороших геймплейных находок.

И конечно же великолепная игра со шрифтами и их подача.


Спорное:
Беккета в оригинале [на английском] не читал, но текст в игре крайне разношерстный. Очень хорошо конечно если вставлены местами оригинальные текста Сэмюэла, но в некоторых моментах провисает страшно - и по содержанию понятно, что это уже какая то отсебятина слабохарактерная и бесталанная.


В итоге:
Середняк. Местами летит, местами проседает. В какой то момент захватывает и не отпускает, но под конец разочаровывает. Брать из любви к Беккету и с целью ""подтянуть"" английский.

0,steam_reviews/588230_Beckett.json,137,8,"Samuel Beckett and Franz Kafka write a story together and get David Lynch to produce it.  That’s what this “game” felt like to me.  I put game in quotes because this is really more of an experience than a conventional game.  Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not complaining.  I enjoyed myself completely and let the exceptional and vivid writing and images wash over me as I travelled along with Beckett on his last case.  I would have been happier without all the insects (as I am sure Beckett would have too), but this is not a happy tale and so insects we have.  Sometimes symbolism just isn’t pretty.

The game saves in short chapters that you can go back and relive if you like.  There are a few choices to be made but the theme remains the same.

I recommend to all who appreciate artistic journeys, great writing, and contemplating the meaning of life.",242,english
0,steam_reviews/588230_Beckett.json,137,8,"Beckett is a good artistic game that I would classify as “extreme”, niche title, not for everyone. Just as the literary and cinematographic genres it’s inispired by.

He is clearly inspired by W. Burroughs novels (Naked Lunch), and consequently by homonymous D. Cronenberg‘s movie, as well as by the macabre surrealism of D. Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet) and Kafka‘s novel Metamorphosis. There is also a certain influence of Czech animation master Jan Švankmajer. Some illustrations reminds me of Lorenzo Mattotti style.

Beckett is a concentrate of despair, a dip in the depression of a dystopian world a la Orwell. There is all the human misery here, seasoned by a pessimistic view of life. Degradation is expressed by characters who are physically rotting, losing their skin and their humanity; they are sad, old, narrow-minded, insignificant, marginalized, weak, sick, depressed, mad, full of ticks and vices, pigeonholed in a flat, hierarchical, organicist society. I wrote characters, but it’s an euphemism. There are many characters, but they are not represented by human figures, they are mostly depicted as insects, and are represented by small circle-shaped icons flattened on the screen.

0,steam_reviews/588230_Beckett.json,137,8,"A pointless and overwrought visual novel, which embraces a mid-century visual aesthetic and text derivative of Boroughs, Kafka and others. Players will know this is art because it is not fun to play. The characters are literally flat archetypes, with no depth, and each speaks and behaves exactly as you’d expect, in as much as reciting a few lines of dialogue each is behaviour. 

Making games that, according to the description above, “stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of literature, theatre and independent world cinema” is not a goal that should be pursued through imitation of those media, because then you end up with a mess such as this. Such comparisons can’t be forced, and reveal a certain insecurity with games as a medium, in contrast to those that have no such preoccupations, such as OneShot or Gris, and yet are far greater artistic achievements than what we have here. 

Becket is much too long and too obsessed with the same ideas over and over again, like Matthew Barney’s Cremaster films (though, if only this were as nice to look at).

You are thrown in a well written nightmarish atmosphere which indeed reminded me of the fictional worlds of Beckett and also Kafka. Visual you also get a lot of alusions. Bunuel is one of them. Dark symbolism and a lot of gore is everywhere. The detective story is only a pretext to throw you into this world.

There are tons of random ways in which you can lose health in this game without the game communicating the danger to you clearly, and even if the danger is communicated, the damage is unavoidable. Try to talk to a guy working on a computer? He starts flailing his arms and you lose health. See fireflies and want to investigate? They attack you and you lose health. See a guy with a box on his head pace around and try to talk to him? Somehow you lose health for that too...

The availability of healing items is limited and their usefulness is limited as they allow you to recover small amounts of health. But there's more, to save the game you also need a special item with limited availability. I'd understand being to save only in specific locations, this has been a mechanic for a very long time, but add to this the Resident Evil requirement to have a specific item to be able to save? Especially with how bad the ""combat"" and controls in this game are?

Oynamaya üşeniyor fakat oyuna girince de başından kalkamadığınız bir oyun. oyunun bir sonu yok asker bas ve saldır temalı bir oyun ve ayrıca kale, kule, liman, üniversite, çiftlik, kütüphane, cephanelik, yatırım( fabrika vb), gibi bir çok şeyde inşaat edebilirsiniz ama dediğim gibi çok derine girilmiyor oyunda. Oyunu kavramakta çok basit.

Yeni başlayanlara tavsiye vereyim

Oyuna başlar başlamaz hemen her yere saldırmayın önce ekonominizi toparlayın ve gelişin. Aksi taktirde adam akıllı genişlemeden ekonomi çöker sonra halk mutsuzlaşır ve isyanlar çıkar. ekonomi kötü olduğundan askerde basamazsınız bu sebeple isyanları bastırmakta zorlanırsınız. En sonda iç savaş patlak verir devlet çöker.

OYUNDA DEVLETİNİZİN BÜTÜN HUDUTLARINDA EN AZ 2000-4000 ARASI ASKER BULUNDURUN BU SİZİ ANİ GELEN BİR SALDIRIYA KARŞI KORUR YADA HIZLI BİR ŞEKİLDE SALDIRMA İMKANI SAĞLAR. OYUNUN İLK BAŞINDA BUNU SAĞLAYAMAYABİLİRSİNİZ FAKAT BELLİ BİR SEVİYEYE ULAŞTIKTAN SONRA BUNU YAPMANIZ ŞARTTIR. ÜLKENİN HER YERİNDEN ASKER BASIN VE BÜTÜN HUDUTLARA DAĞITIN SAVAŞLARDA ÇOK FAYDASINI GÖRECEKSİNİZ.

Teklonoji puanlarınızı iyi kullanın mesela Osmanlıda oynuyorsanız Fatih S. M. zamanından başlıyo ve ekonomi çok da iyi değil bu yüzden Osmanlı imparatorluğunda diğer puanlardan çok  VERGİ GELİRİ VE EKONOMİ BÜYÜMESİNE ÖNEM VERİN ki ekonominiz daha çabuk toparlansın. Ardından gelişip ekonomi toparlandıysa yada toparlandığına inanıyorsanız saldıracağınız devlet dışında bütün sınır komşularınızla saldırmazlık paktı imzalayın ve ilişkileri geliştirin, böylece bütün sınırlarınız güvence altında olup güvenle saldırabilirsiniz. bu taktikle çevrenizdeki bir çok devleti ortadan kaldırır yolunuza bakarsınız. 

Eğer ki Türkiye de oynuyorsanız
Balkanlara sakın açılmayın. İlk önce Suriyeyi alın, ardından FİLİSTİN, İSRAİL, IRAK gibi orta doğu devletlerini ortadan kaldırın. ardından büyük ihtimalle Arabistan sizden İran'a saldırmak için askeri geçiş izini isteyecek buna izin verin ve İran'a hızlı bir şekilde Arabistan ile beraber alın unutmayın topraklarınız ne kadar büyürse o kadar fazla vergi geliri alırsınız sonra Arabistan, Mısır derken Asya'ya açılın. Türkiye oynuyorsanız Gürcistan'ı ele geçirin aksi taktirde Rusya alacak orayı. Türkiye'nin bütün Rusya sınırına asker basın Ruslara asla ama asla güvenmeyin Rusların olduğu her yere asker yığın denizlerde dahil bu sayede ani bir Rus saldırısına kurban gitmeyeceksiniz. Balkanlarda Romanya Yunanistan'a girmiştir çoktan balkanlardan da gözünüzü ayırmayın düşene de bir tekme siz vurun baktınız Romanya Yunanistan'ı yiyor. Yunan topraklarından göz hakkı sizde pay alın özellikle ege adalarını. Yunanistan'dan sonra da Bulgaristan, Romanya, Bosna Hersek, Arnavutluk derken Avrupaya girmeye başlarsınız.

bu yollardan giderseniz ve iyi yönetirseniz birazda video izler fikir sahibi olursanız. 
bu taktiklerle Türkiye oynarsanız ARAP YARIM ADASI, ORTA DOĞU(SURİYE IRAK FİLİSTİN İSRAİL LÜBNAN VB), İRAN(İran üzerinden PAKİSTAN ÖZBEKİSTAN VE KAZAKİSTAN'I alır oradan da ve elini Hindistan) MISIR. Kafkasyada da GÜRCİSTAN, ele geçirmek isterseniz de AZERBAYCAN. Balkanlarda YUNANİSTAN ROMANYA BULGARİSTAN BOSNA HERSEK ARNAVUTLUK gibi yerlere açılırsınız büyürsünüz.

Or les joutes ont pour moi un feeling tout juste passable, qui me semble assez proche d'un mix des systèmes objectivement ""moyens"" de Witcher 3 et d'Assassins Creed Odyssey [i](qui malgré leurs aspects sympas ont des mécaniques de combats que j'ai toujours trouvées molles du fion à jouer, l'aspect baston étant à mes yeux très secondaire dans ces licences).[/i]

Esthétiquement on se rapproche plus de la qualité d'un très joli MMO, mais techniquement limité (façon Black Desert) : c'est certes splendide sur le plan artistique, mais nettement moins brillant sur le plan du moteur.
En fait, GreedFall est comme les peintures hollandaises du 17e siècle dont il restitue remarquablement l'atmosphère : il faut le regarder de suffisamment loin, sans trop coller son nez sur les détails, afin que la magie de sa direction artistique magnifiquement inspirée puisse opérer.

De plus, contrairement à ce qu'indique le 2nd Tag de sa page Steam, ce n'est pas réellement un monde ouvert, il s'agit plutôt de grandes zones auxquelles on accède par une sorte de Hub. Mais ces détails sont ils réellement gênants? En fait non.

Si le premier contact avec les combats et l'aspect technique m'a carrément refroidie, le jeu tient quand même très bien la route dès lors qu'on met raisonnablement ses attentes à jour et qu'on découvre ses autres vertus inattendues.
Mais les nombreuses qualités du jeu étant naturellement listées dans la majorité des évals, je vais me concentrer ici sur les petits trucs qui (à mes yeux) clochent un peu.

- Déjà, problème de reconnaissance de mon pad : je dois à CHAQUE lancement redémarrer le jeu plusieurs fois avant qu'il soit reconnu (et dès lors, plus aucun souci en jeu).

- Dans certaines zones, l'optimisation est juste dégueulasse : même en baissant la qualité d'Ultra à Moyen, des saccades plus ou moins graves viennent bien trop souvent hacher l'animation.
Or ma config [i](supérieure à celle recommandée : 16Go Ram + GTX1060-6Go + drivers à jour)[/i] fait tourner sans souci en ultra et en fluidité constante des jeux bien plus impressionnants.
Je veux bien tolérer occasionnellement des baisses de FPS acceptables tant que cette gourmandise est justifié par une qualité visuelle inattaquable, mais c'est loin d'être le cas ici vu ce qu'affiche poussivement ce moteur un peu daté. J'espère donc un hotfix rapidos, car voir le framerate passer littéralement en mode ""diapositives"" par moments commence à bien me saouler.

- Ensuite, il y a ce système de combat, qui malgré ses innovations n'est franchement pas très jouissif à pratiquer je trouve.
Deux remarques à ce sujet :
✱ Un lock des cibles assez déroutant, qui rend les combats patauds et brouillons : quand je cible un ennemi, je m'attend à pouvoir ""tourner rapidement autour"". Or ici, au lieu que les mouvements s'aménagent autour de l'axe de la cible engagée, les déplacements trop lents et la caméra restent quasi-identiques, chose que je trouve très désagréable.
De plus, si on se bat contre un groupe et que la cible meurt, la nouvelle cible aléatoire est souvent choisie à perpette plutôt qu'au contact : pénible.
✱ Malgré l'indéniable richesse du système de combat, les affrontements de boss sensés être ""épiques"" ne sont pas super prenants. Le fait que les possibilités de base soient au début volontairement limitées n'y est sans doute pas étranger (ex: la ridicule esquive qu'on se coltine jusqu'à l'éventuel déblocage d'une roulade décente dans l'arbre de talents)...

- Le système de furtivité est un peu kafkaïen puisque les ennemis ne voient pas les compagnons. Ces derniers sont d'ailleurs carrément gênants lorsqu'un rapide retour sur vos pas est nécessaire, contribuant donc à vous faire repérer. [i](Ils vous collent de si près qu'ils bouchent la retraite dans les petits labyrinthes étriqués qui servent souvent de théâtre aux phases d'infiltration).[/i]
Laborieux donc, malgré l'option d'augmenter sa furtivité par divers moyens ou d'éventuellement résoudre la quête d'une autre façon.

- Globalement, il me semble qu'il y a un indéfinissable problème avec la caméra et les déplacements étrangement imprécis, presque flottants. Par exemple une fois sur 3, l'inertie du perso condamné à ""courir lentement"" l'arrête plus loin que le coffre qu'on cherche à ouvrir, obligeant souvent à réajuster sa position.[i] (Élargir le cône et la portée d'interaction avec les objets pourrait résoudre ce problème).[/i]
Quelque chose ne va pas avec l'angle de vue - car sans parler de ses caprices lorsqu'on se bat près d'un mur, je crois que c'est un des rares jeux ou utiliser la caméra de base me donne littéralement des nausées. Baisser le FOV d'un cran [i](options > vidéo > champ de vision)[/i] et la vitesse de la caméra de 2 crans [i](options de contrôles > sensibilité caméra)[/i] à heureusement bien estompé ce souci chez moi.

- Malgré des animations assez archaïques, (notamment les expressions faciales), le chara-design franchement réussi rattrape très bien les choses dans l'ensemble. Et de toute façon, lire les sous-titres distrait l’œil de la synchro labiale zarbi.

Globalement, le jeu propose des options bienvenues, comme sa petite création de perso certes très basique dans la conception physique, mais tout de même bien sympa avec ses 3 classes au choix. J'apprécie également qu'on propose 4 niveaux de difficulté : Histoire, Normal, Difficile, et Extrême.
Le système d'équipiers me rappelle les pions de l'excellent Dragon's Dogma, et bien que n'étant pas du tout fan de multi, j'adore en revanche cette sensation paradoxale de jouer à la fois seule et en équipe.
On peut d'ailleurs noter d'autres ressemblances avec cet excellent titre, dont je trouve la proposition et le feeling d'exploration un peu similaire une fois en jeu. [i](Or dans la mesure ou D.D.Dark Arisen fait précisément partie de mes jeux préférés, c'est à mes yeux un excellent point).[/i]
GreedFall fourmille de petits détails plaisants, comme l'exploration très bien récompensée par un loot abondant, la possibilité d'équiper son avatar et ses troupes d'armes variées et de vêtements classieux qui seront bien visibles sur les personnages en jeu (là encore une vétille cosmétique qui peut sembler anecdotique, mais qui - l'air de rien, apporte pas mal de personnalité au jeu).
Tout comme son lore très travaillé, que l'on découvre au fil des quêtes principales ou secondaires (certes beaucoup trop ""Fedex"", mais étonnamment bien écrites), et pleines de choix manifestement porteurs de conséquences ultérieures.
L'idée des dialogues spéciaux en fonction de quels équipiers vous accompagnent à tel ou tel endroit est très cool aussi.
J'ajoute que la carte et les menus sont plutôt clairs et ergonomiques, et ce, même à la manette...
Il est d'ailleurs possible de configurer un paquet de raccourcis pour éviter d'avoir à trop utiliser l'étrange ""Pause Tactique"" en plein combat, et donc de trop foutre en l'air le rythme des joutes. Assez pratique.

Bref, personnellement, je trouve que les combats de GreedFall sont finalement un aspect assez secondaire du jeu, dont l'intérêt réside assez clairement ailleurs, dans sa facette aventure / exploration / immersion que je trouve en revanche bien plus intéressante et mieux écrite que ce à quoi je m'attendais. [i](Exactement comme pour Witcher.3 et AC.Odyssey que je citais en intro).[/i]

Donc malgré un premier contact décevant avec ses facettes ""technique & action"" dont j'attendais sans doute beaucoup trop, [i](inconsciemment, tricornes et Boss géants me faisaient peut-être naïvement rêver d'un Bloodborne-like)[/i], j'ai finalement eu d'excellentes surprises sur d'autres aspects dont je n’espérais pourtant pas grand chose.
Et de ce fait, je le recommande sans souci aux amateurs du genre.",3042,french

Le système de combat et de déplacement est ""peut mieux faire"" dans le même délire qu'un Dragon Age inquisition. 
Choisir un système de parade dans ce genre de jeu est étonnant voir franchement bizarre. Après il est assez facile. On est pas dans du Sekiro non plus. 

Voilà pour les trucs sur lesquels on peut chipoter. Maintenant de Dieu c'est un RPG. Le jeu prend son temps et est là pour vous raconter une histoire.
Personnellement j'aime maintenant beaucoup de gens trouveront ça lent.
J'ai clean toute la première partie du jeu (Serene) avec ces quêtes secondaires et on sent que le jeu essaye de captiver le joueur dans son univers.

0,steam_reviews/620_Portal2.json,343768,1,"(Graphismes)
Le moteur graphique n'est pas le point fort du jeu. Le Source Engine prend vraiment de l'âge malgré quelques mises à jour et on reconnaît des textures issues de Half-Life 2. Par ailleurs, sur Xbox 360, l'aliasing est étrangement très prononcé alors que les versions PS3 et PC n'en souffrent pas. Heureusement, l'esthétique et le design sauvent la mise et il suffit d'avoir admiré Atlas ou P-Body se prendre un mur en plein saut pour pardonner les lacunes techniques.

(Jouabilité)
Jouer à Portal 2 c'est redécouvrir le bonheur de faire face à une énigme complexe, qui semble insoluble et qui pourtant dispose d'une solution qui à la fin nous semble si évidente qu'elle en est forcément géniale. Les mécaniques sont intelligentes et le gameplay est aussi original que novateur, en solo comme dans l'excellentissime mode coop.

(Bande son)
La B.O. mise sur la musique électronique, à la fois discrète et de qualité, ce qui colle à la perfection à l'univers. Les doublages en V.O. sont d'une qualité rare, essentiellement grâce à l'acteur Stephen Merchant (Wheatley). La V.F. n'a pas non plus à rougir et dans les deux cas, les dialogues sont jouissifs.

(Scénario)
Le scénario comprend quelques rebondissements, et un éclairage sur l'histoire des laboratoires Aperture mais surtout, c'est l'univers si particulier de Portal, coincé entre les Monty Pythons et Kafka, qui transpire de chaque bout de mur, que l'on aime et qu'on ne veut plus quitter. Notez que si vous espériez la mise en évidence du lien entre Portal et Half-Life, n'en attendez pas trop au-delà du clin d'oeil.",2834,french
0,steam_reviews/621060_PCBuildingSimulator.json,47553,1,"There are few things more meta than a PC game where you build your own PC. PC Building Simulator gives you the experience of being a one-person PC-building workshop, juggling moody customers with various demands. Your tasks could be as simple as blowing dust out of an older computer and scanning for viruses or, as you level up, it could be to build an entire PC from scratch.

If you’re not a PC-building aficionado, the game simplifies the hobby to make it more newbie-friendly. You won’t have to spend time managing your cables, for instance, as the game does this for you. It also points out where the motherboard, GPU, CPU, fans, and various parts are, highlighting units you can remove and obstacles that are in your way. That saves time, which is great because a game like this can already take up many hours, and keeping that real-life difficulty level wouldn’t make the game more fun.

One of the best parts of actually building a PC is physically feeling the glass, metal, and cables assemble into something that can eventually hum. Although you obviously lose the tactile touch in the game, PC Building Simulator makes up for it with other thrills like your shop turning a profit over time, customers giving you five-star ratings, and hitting a benchmark on 3DMark.

The game does skip out on some of the difficulties of actually launching your own business — your uncle Timbo has bequeathed you his company after heading off on vacation to drink sangria — but its developers are clearly aware of the challenges, and they poke fun at them through whimsical emails you receive from your customers and, at one point, your bank. You start the game with negative $15 because Timbo hilariously ran a one-star service and borrowed $15 for gas money. When you inevitably overdraw too much cash to buy your first set of parts, the bank offers you a free overdraft limit of $1,000 because “we know life doesn’t always run smoothly.” I burst out laughing at this point, but the ludicrous nature of the business lends the game a kind of reverse-Kafka flavor. No matter how bad things seem to get, life will continue to give you a pass so that everything will be all right in the end.

Indeed, the rating system in the game for how well your business is serving customers only counts the previous reviews, so soon, you can push out the poor reviews of uncle Timbo’s service with glowing ratings of your own. Rent is $500, which seems like a lot at first, but it quickly becomes a paltry sum once the orders start rolling in. The real satisfaction comes from fixing a lot of PCs and feeling like an expert.

While the game does make you become more familiar with PC parts and the tutorial is certainly newbie-friendly, there are times when at least some knowledge of building PCs comes in handy. For instance, it asks you to upgrade a person’s RAM sticks, but it doesn’t tell you that you need to get the identical make and model of the existing RAM stick already in the PC in order to be compatible. If you’re not familiar with how to build a PC, you could potentially get stuck multiple times while you’re playing this game.

There are a few quality-of-life issues; it’d be nice to be able to seamlessly shop while checking customer order emails to buy products more quickly, for instance, or for users to buy back parts they sold off. The game runs into a major speed bump as you get to higher levels and more is demanded of you. I got stuck trying to hit certain benchmarks in 3DMark and continuously swapping out CPUs and GPUs to fit a customer’s budget, so the game’s charm started to wear off.

The promises of dollars in my in-game company bank account seemed to taunt me, reminding me that instead of repeating the same tasks over and over in a video game, I could be earning dollars in real life doing similarly dry tasks on other internet sites. The tediousness of completing task after task in exchange for high ratings reminded me a lot of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, minus any moneymaking potential.

The concept of a PC-building game could have easily turned out to be tedious. But PC Building Simulator is crisp and fresh, at least for the first few levels. It even has an original soundtrack, including a rap song about building the ultimate PC, which perfectly encapsulates a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously.",41805,english

[i]Disco Elysium[/i] is a lot of things. It's about solving a mystery that could be the catalyst to a violent collapse of society, but also a personal journey of self-discovery as your amnesiac character rediscovers his past demons. It has fantastical elements, but also emphasizes the mundane reality of many stories. It is equal parts melancholic and macabre, but also absurd and hilarious at times. But. it's these contradictions add up to make [i]Disco Elysium[/i] one of the most fascinating and impressive titles to be released not only this year, but this decade.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

This game shares many similarities with other modern isometric RPGs visually, barring the unique setting of this game. It resembles a watercolor painting made by someone who adores the color gray, but accentuates more vibrant colors to ensure that the world doesn't feel lifeless. And like most RPGs, the faces of the characters you meet all resemble painted portraits, but the characters themselves are designed in a way that bring out their grotesque beauty as they struggle in a world on the brink of chaos. The world feels gloomy, in all the right ways, as it borrows from dystopian worlds, with just a hint of cyberpunk influences and 1920's-30's technology to further set the immense world apart from your average RPG. Overall, the visual design as a whole does an excellent job of establishing the story's tone while using a unique setting to tell it. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The name of the game here is talking, and when you have a game daring enough to [i]outright remove combat[/i] in an already text-heavy genre, you will be doing a LOT of talking no matter what kind of approach you try to take. Speaking of approaches, one of the things [i]Disco Elysium[/i] takes pride in is the variety of ways you can approach a situation, and offering a means of still continuing the game, even when you fail your skill checks in dialogue. However, the game is actually quite linear. Regardless of how you approach things, it starts and ends the same way. Some may see this as a criticism, but I believe the fun of the game comes from [i]how[/i] you reach the end. You can play the intelligent douchebag cop, the sensitive cop that is able to read people like a book but has a few screws loose upstairs, or you can just make your own approach and get by with that. There are so many different ways to get the answer to a question (or ways to just circumvent the question altogether), but of course, this doesn't add up to the bigger picture. Your choices DO matter because there are a lot of smaller-scale events that impact the game, but how the story ends remains mostly the same. And while I love getting from point A to point B in my own way, once you reach point B, skill checks become frustrating as you're pretty much forced onto a linear path from there. Of course, as I said earlier, the game still progresses forward even when you fail, but skill checks become more frustrating to lose because they often end up being the only way to reach a certain outcome instead of offering viable alternatives. The restriction of the variety in choice at the end does leave a bitter taste in your mouth, but it's not in a major way. Aside from that, though, I'll admit that the linear structure is fine here because it's still fun to try and figure out your past and the mystery itself, but it's very much a game that is about the journey rather than the destination.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Without a doubt, this game's biggest strength is easily the incredible writing. It gives a text-heavy game more life than many gameplay-focused games out today. For example, you can have a conversation with your stomach about embracing fascism. But for this review, I'd like to especially focus on how extremely well-written the characters are. My favorite is Kim Kitsuragi, who I believe is one of the best companions in any RPG ever. His dry humor and analytical nature serves as the perfect foil for your character's wacky antics. He is a source of entertainment, but also a source of hope for you in the suffering world of Revachol. There is so much depth packed into every character that each playthrough can be different simply because of how each character can prove to your investigation. I found myself clicking on every single thing I could, just to read what the game had to say, and the incredible writing really helped draw me into this deep, complex world. Speaking of which, the worldbuilding is not only massive, but jaw-droppingly insane as well, as it has been fleshed out over ~15 years(?). The most controversial aspect of the story is the ending, but I didn't actually mind how it played out. Some people thought it was a stupid, out-of-left-field reveal, but there are plenty of details in the game that help point you in the right direction and foreshadow the ending. It's better than it sounds, and plays well into some of the game's themes. However, I will say my main story criticism is its pacing, being stuck in a similar trap to [i]Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild[/i] by presenting a high-stakes situation that needs to be addressed immediately, but not pushing it on the player or punishing them for remaining idle or focusing too much on side activities. Unfortunately, to discuss the story any further from there would be going into spoiler territory, and this game is at its best if you walk into it completely blind, so in conclusion, the story is very, very good aside from some pacing issues.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

No game is perfect, and [i]Disco Elysium's[/i] Achilles' heel is its voice acting. It's not completely awful, but it's so inconsistent that some of the voice acting feels very amateur, and can break the immersion of the game. This wasn't always a problem, but the shift to mediocre voice acting for certain characters happened enough for me to need to address it. The music, however, is great, ranging from being chilling vocal tracks to peaceful disco tunes. There isn't much else to say here, but at least the music somewhat makes up for the voice acting.

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

I played this game with some Wi-Fi issues, so my actual playtime is around 20 hours. However, there are varying accounts of how long this game will take for some people. I've heard of a bare minimum of about 16 hours, but there are some people getting upwards of 35 hours. But with the amount of ways you can approach a situation and the different quests that can open up from them, this game does have a lot to offer. The ending might remain the same, but if you enjoyed the journey itself enough, then you will definitely be able to replay the game. Otherwise, there is so much to think about regarding the game's story, characters, and themes that it will certainly resonate with you for a long time, and the excellent writing helps make it a very quotable game. Therefore, the game is certainly worth buying at full price, especially considering it's $20 than your standard AAA game.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

To conclude, [i]Disco Elysium[/i] is very ambitious, but it's very successful in what it sets out to do. It's not for everyone, but those who appreciate the complexities of its world and its Kafkaesque, existential themes will be delighted with one of the most unique RPGs of this generation. I adored this game despite its flaws, and I cannot wait to see what else the developers do with this universe.

[h2] Mecânica [/h2] 

 
O jogo é um cRPG tradicional em questão mecânica, nenhum grande desafio de agilidade ou memória muscular te espera, você não deve estar lá pra isso, tudo gira em torno da rolagem dos dados de seus atributos e perícias. Esses dados são modificados, claro, pelos seus atributos iniciais e onde você investe seus pontos de XP durante o jogo, seus itens (vestes) também podem te dar e tirar modificadores. Tem também os pensamentos que podem ser internalizados, funciona como um sistema de pesquisa, você os coloca em uma fila de gerenciamento e eles se produzem ao decorrer de um tempo pré-estabelecido. Esses pensamentos também podem dar modificadores de dado ou bônus passivo em ganho de XP ou coleta e etc... 
 
Falando em tempo; ele não roda sozinho e sim avança baseado no quanto tu conversas ou lê pelo jogo e se isso parecer um problema fica tranquilo que tu tens muito texto para administrar, são 1.2 milhões de palavras no jogo, é mais palavra do que tem em qualquer língua, mais que o dobro do que temos em português por exemplo, tanto que o jogo com frequência mistura idiomas e expressões dentro da mesma frase. 

A movimentação é basicamente point n’ click, o botão esquerdo anda e interage e o direito revela uma visão ressaltada do que lhe cerca. 

Não ser um jogo de combate não significa que você não tem vida, o mundo pode e vai te machucar, seja por tropeçar, cair, dar de cara em algo, se chocar contra uma idosa em uma cadeira de rodas enquanto voa de costas com os dedos do meio apontados para o dono do hotel que você tem dormido e manda ele se foder ou até mesmo acaricia uma espinhosa árvore que “trama em silêncio contra a humanidade”  

Palavras também machucam aqui, além do HP você vai encontrar um sistema de Moral, passar vergonha, ser humilhado e afins te ferem, assim como ser elogiado ou acertar um palpite pode recuperar ela naturalmente. 
 
Zerar a vida ou moral são resultantes em Game Over então se cuide. Embora seja natural que se termine o jogo sem grandes complicações em relação a isso. 
 
Ah, claro, as drogas. Cigarro, bebida, rebite e outros remédios opioides te dão vantagens temporárias em atributos ao custo de vida ou moral. 

[h2] Mundo e Personagens [/h2] 

Não estamos na terra, estamos em Elysium, um mundo completamente diferente do nosso e simultaneamente tão semelhante. Não só isso, estamos em Ravachol, a antiga capital do mundo em seus tempos monárquicos, berço de uma grandiosa revolução comunista que logo em seguida foi tomada pelos órgãos moralistas liberais a força e transformada em uma periferia do capitalismo. 

O fato de ser literalmente todo um novo mundo traz também nova regras, não sociais, mas sim físicas. Não se surpreenda pelas contemplações do absurdo que te cercam, nesse sentido tu se encontra numa ofuscada fronteira entre o absurdo de Kafka e o terror cósmico de Lovecraft, cabe a você o como lidar com esse mundo. Se assustando com o fim inevitável a partir do inexplicável? Talvez, mas apesar dos absurdos que o cercam tu ainda tem um trabalho a fazer e problemas a resolver, mesmo que seus corpo se transformasse em barata tu ainda tem uma lista a terminar. 

 
O distrito de Martinese é onde você explora, não só em um país que hoje é a ruína do que tinha sido uma vitoriosa tomada dos meios de produção você está na área mais pobre dela, a periferia da periferia. O lugar é controlado pelo sindicato local, que é composto pelos trabalhadores do porto de uma corporação multinacional que ali se instaurou. A região é pequena, mas é rica em história, tanto de seus lugares que outrora abrigaram os mais ardentes revolucionários, tanto de seus personagens que hoje tentam apenas sobreviver das sobras do antigo mundo, todos os personagens são intensamente marcados pelo local e o local tem cicatrizes de seus personagens, veias abertas pulsando por algo grandioso e incerto que ninguém sabe o que é. 
 
Algo muito grande está prestes a acontecer a muito tempo e nunca acontece, e cada vez mais as promessas de futuro dadas pelo seu passado parecem mais longes e a esperança foi tomada. Comunistas e anarquistas foram fuzilados, monarquistas ficaram no passado e hoje só se vê fascistas e liberais fazendo promessas vazias para terem seus ganhos próprios.

[i]""The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.""[/i]

[b]PLEASE READ THIS TO AVOID RELEASE BUGS:[/b]
1. Run the game as administrator to avoid not being able to save from Day 2.
2. (Mild, very mild spoiler) The first thing you should do is get your shoe from the balcony. Do not save until you have. Only mild annoyance would ensue if you didn't but that was enough for me to restart.
[i][THESE ISSUES WILL LIKELY BE FIXED QUICKLY BUT FOR PEOPLE PURCHASING RIGHT NOW THIS IS VERY RELEVANT.][/i]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

[b]+ Hilarious.[/b] Straight up, laugh out loud funny while still managing to be quite thought provoking amid the chaos. It fluctuates between rampant immaturity and existential philosophising. Think Deadpool punching cocaine into his mask crossed with a healthy dose of Kafka. 
[b]+RPG Character Development Done Right.[/b] I always find there's more freedom to choose how you want to be when the option of who we want to be is removed. Geralt for instance, seems to have more difference between his potential decisions than your character in Fallout say. There is depth there, whereas Fallout or Skyrim focus more on breadth, you can be whoever you want to be but you'lll find when you get to a decision there's likely 2-3 outcomes. I've played the first day of Disco Elysium three times with three different builds (of the same main character). Without spoiling anything let me tell you that there is a lot of difference and replayability there and I would suggest just making your character insanely good at one thing as the presets suggest. Balance works too but the game really starts to shine when you're a 'Physical instrument' or a psychic detective or a supreme intellect. This also gives you a lot more room for multiple playthroughs.
[b]+ Levelling up and the Thought System[/b] Unique, well thought out and incredibly well implemented. Be careful with thoughts, I've wasted a few skill points on things I didn't like or need. I'm not going to say anymore about that for fear of spoilers but let's just say it's in the 'pro' category for a reason and it wasn't an annoyance.
[b]+ Adult themes done right[/b] Fans of old school Fallout will be very at home here. How the game deals with drugs, racism, sexism, sex, etc. is spot on. I've seen people on the forums worrying this would be an SJW fest and quite the opposite is true. You can make your character an 'SJW' should you so wish and find moral rewards in your liberalism. Equally you can become a complete raving facist, a pragmatic racial purist, a woman hating incel that punches doors and screams 'Wh*re!' through them when he doesn't get an answer. And no matter what you choose you'll find shades of all of this in the world around you. I was legitimately surprised, let's say, at how far this game is willing to go in making you feel like a real piece of sh*t.
[b]+ World and Lore[/b] From what I understand the games creator has been working on this world for a long, long time. We play a game set in a small corner of it, at a crucial time in it's history. It's best to go in blind but let me say for the sake of review that this shows. It shines in fact. I could inhabit this world for a while longer and I certainly intend to.
[b]+ Voice Acting[/b] I could be pedantic about this and put the voice acting in the cons category too. It's hit and miss, really just a couple of characters that miss but the ones that hit sure make up for it. 
[b]+ Graphics[/b] Lavish, beautiful and depressing. It may be of note that I am both a writer and an illustrator professionally and in both spheres this game has blown me away.

[b]Pro that I cannot avoid mild spoilers for[/b]

[spoiler][b]+ You converse with your skills.[/b] It took me a moment to understand what exactly was going on with the conversation in Disco Elysium. The skills you pick are functions of your brain and body: reaction speed, pain threshold, inland empire. As you navigate the world and characters (and yourself) you talk to these functions. You conversate about your responses and skill checks and they all have their own personalities. Electro-chemistry wants to get you f**ked up! It has to be played to be properly experienced but it works very well.[/spoiler] 

[h1]Con[/h1]

[b]+Timed playthroughs[/b] Some people may love them, I think playthroughs that limit how long you can spend in them are always to the detriment of player freedom. it may increase replayability but at the cost of being able to get comfortably lost for hours. This may not bother most people, for me it's the only negative in a sea of gold. I think for a sequel though it may be pertinent to just remove this aspect of there being a set amount of days. That kind of ties in to these next two points - and please god give us a sequel.

[b]Not really cons but things I would look to in the sequel[/b]

[b]Some combat mechanics?[/b] Truth be told it doesn't really need them. I'm only on Day 2 and I've enacted plenty of violence on people that's all roll based. I just think maybe these segments could be a bit more extended and free flowing.
[b]Size of the game world[/b]I've seen people complaining that the world is too small. I don't think it is, I think it's extremely well filled out and again hat's off to the creator for finding a healthy scope to be able to succeed in. My hope is there will be a higher budget for a sequel and subsequently we can explore more of this world.

If any of those last three points have caused you to think this game is short, or small, or unambitious then I can assure you it is not. I think £35 is a fair deal on this game and it's exactly the sort of title you should support. No pre-order BS, no platform switching or paid exclusivity or season pass or any of the stupidity we've come to accept as normal. If £35 is too much for 60 hours of joy, hilarity and introspection then spend it to support games that aren't trying to keep you in a cycle of grind and payment. This is art baby! This is Disco!

0,steam_reviews/632470_DiscoElysium-TheFinalCut.json,76471,13,"This point and click adventure game, in the vein of Kings Quest, Maniac Mansion, and Monkey Island, takes place in a fictional post-modern world of semi-recognizable economic, political, and philosophical turmoil.  It's a sort of 70's electro-punk (cyberpunk without the cyber, steampunk without the steam) setting with a highly polarized corporate-union class failing economy.  You play a police officer of the local Militia-Police -- an almost powerless authority organization due to the deteriorated economy and disorganized political scene.  Your job is to investigate a murder.  But given that you've just lost all of your memory from a self-induced binge of drugs and alcohol, you must not only solve the crime, but also rediscover your lost identity, and perhaps rebuild a new one.
There is a complex system of attributes that not only determines success or failure (using a table-top role playing game style dice rolling mechanic), but also determines how the story is narrated to you, various internal monologues pipe-up and contribute to the voluminous narration depending on your attribute/skill values.
There is a lot of reading.  No let me rephrase that.  There is a gargantuan butt-load of reading.  No action.  Clicking on where you want to walk, what you want to ""fiddle with"", and who you want to talk to, encompasses all of the action.  Mostly you are reading narration.  Navigating conversations with others (and your introspective self) by choosing from a list of responses.  And occasionally rolling the dice to see if you succeeded or failed at some task.
There is a fair amount of inventory management (although you appear to have an unlimited inventory space) using various items to interact with your environment, making some tasks easier or harder, and solving simple you-must-have-this-to-do-that puzzles in order to progress the story line.
The charm of the game is the witty, creative, and unorthodox character of the narration of the story.  Full of psuedo-alternative-reality-pop-culture-econo-political-philosophical musings.  It reminds me of a strange mixture of an old-school Steve Meretzky's INFOCOM text adventure and a Franz Kafka novel.
If that intrigues you, this is definitely your game.  If not, it's going to be very hit or miss.  Not for the action gamer.  Did I mention there's a gargantuan butt-load of reading?  That pretty much tells you all you need to know.

0,steam_reviews/632470_DiscoElysium-TheFinalCut.json,76471,13,"Disco Elysium is definitely something else in the RPG genre, but it's very far from ""the best RPG"" deemed by so many reviews. Here's where it succeeds and where it fails; let's start with the good.

Mature writing: this is the most vital part of the game. The dialogues are well written, sometimes makes you laugh sincerely, other times invokes the existential dread of a good hangover. They feel organic, and where it matters, you can have meaningful conversations with meaningful dialogue options. Sadly, meaningful gets wiped away midways to the game.

Politics: the game heavily relies on you choosing political affiliations. Left or right, anarchist or a doomsday preacher. That's nice. The devs for sure know what they're talking about when it comes to this.

Lore/Worldbuilding: it's elaborate. It's like something that came out of Kafka literature. Not my cup of tea, but some may find it attractive. And it's elaborate - there's tons of lore you can dig into.

Now to the bad.

They pushed Kafquese feeling way too far. You interact with your thoughts, which is cool crazy, to begin with. But midways, that schizophrenic BS that you keep hearing is just irritating. It looks like that whole world is filled with nonsensical characters. And that's your only way of getting around.

The dialogues contribute to the lore in a tedious way. Instead of meaningful exchanges, you'll get pointless blabber, which can be fun for a while, but it really isn't when you're thinking of a full game experience. I did 40+ hours and can't do it anymore. 

Tasks? Load of BS. The beginning is promising, gathering subtle clues on what causes your massive alcohol-induced amnesia. But later on: some punks want to make a disco in a church? Don't give a fuck. A senior zoologist is placing traps to catch a mythical animal? I couldn't care less. Buy some pants...buy some dice...do some drugs... All of this needs to be tied up in at least some meaningful way, and it isn't. I literally had more fun doing rat quests in other games.

Railroading is there as well. Until you've done some BS here or there, you simply won't be able to make success rolls to continue. You can get XP by exhausting conversations - and there's tons of that - but I simply got tired of listening to conversations equivalent to Fox News. THIS GAME NEEDS TO MAKE MORE SENSE.

In the end, it's hard to maintain interest in the main quest because you're forced to go through some really off-the-topic stuff—a lot.

BUY WITH CAUTION. It's an ambitious attempt at something different, which is admirable, but the execution lacks substance and continuity.",2588,english

Gamer background: I like strategy and artsy shit.

It's basically a point-and-click adventure game, with a gigaton of text and dialogue trees. You put points into different skills, and use clothes items for skill bonuses, to pass different skill checks. No combat, nothing but walking around talking to people and occasionally managing xp and items. Not too difficult either- you never get ""stuck"" and there's no item puzzles. 

What's good about it is that the writing just fucking slaps. Like I get kinda bored by point-and-click stuff (although I liked fallen london and Vahalla bartending so maybe I am a text guy), but I was enamoured enough by this to read a conversation that lasted 40 minutes. It's both funny and serious/depressing (sometimes at the same time), and gets really smart and political: tons of discussions about communism, facism, euro welfare-stateism, the purpose of art, existential stuff. There's a lot of liberal arts jingo, so if you're not a big fan of like, Kafka or The Economist, you might not get that much out of this game. If you are though, boy are you in for a treat. Characters were strong and interesting, diolouge was snappy and sometimes hilariously graphic, and I found myself really trying to pull the mystery together in my head. 

The thing that really pulls the game together, though, are the skills. The skill options are really weird and creative- ""hand-eye coordination,"" ""electrochemistry"" (basically your sensititvity and compulsion to drugs and sex), ""authority."" They're basically characters in your head that give you advice if they're leveled high enough, but often will try to push you to play a certain way (and they give, and sometimes take away, diologe options). Each one has their own personality, and if leveled high enough, will get you to do insane things (authority will get you to constantly assert dominance, electrochemistry will get you to do drugs, drama will get you to say insane shit in the middle of a conversation). It was a ton of fun choosing what skill to level in, and seeing that skill pop up in conversation (and often arguing with other skills). I leveled up a ton in ""Shivers"" because I had no idea what that would do, and at high levels my cop guy would just stop in the middle of the street and ""understand the wind."" Amazing experiance. 

The 3D art was kinda lame, but the character portraits were really artsy and creative- they're somewhere between a propoganda poster and a jackson pollack- i would hang one up on my wall. Music was functional but nothing to write home about. No bugs or anything (in the computer sense), but it wasn't a super complicated game to begin with. I finished it in about 21 hours (over 5 days), thinking about replaying it with different skills after a few months.

tldr: top-tier writing, really really fun skill system, engaging story, really artsy/political One of my top 10 games of all time, probably. Do not play if you're looking for puzzles or combat, or you don't like liberal arts/history jingo.",5523,english
0,steam_reviews/632470_DiscoElysium-TheFinalCut.json,76471,13,"Gripping, narrative, screwball, hard-boiled detective CRPG somewhat reminiscent of Planescape: Torment in terms of tone and depth.  Different, sometimes opposing, aspects of the main character's personality deliver the majority of the game's dialogue in a considerably schizophrenic manner.  This creates an intense, emotionally involved, and oftentimes hilarious portrayal of the character's inner thought process, revealing a self-destructive mind shattered by drug abuse, guilt, shame(lessness), neglect, heartache, the rigors of a severely stressful vocation, and the usually soul-crushing nature of existence.  This leaves the player to choose how to manage the recovery (or further meltdown) of our intrepid hero as we attempt to drunkenly fumble our way through a murder investigation fraught with Draconian as well as Kafkaesque twists and turns, whilst simultaneously reclaiming fragments of memories forgotten (with good reason).  The game does provide our character with some emotional support in the form of a loyal, if somewhat judgmental, partner and an opportunity to find redemption and even, dare I say, spiritual enlightenment.

0,steam_reviews/695920_SuperSeducerHowtoTalktoGirls.json,1638,1,"Um jogo financeiramente humilde, apesar de o protagonista se fazer de rico em algumas missões: os cenários e as atrizes são claramente reaproveitados. O formato de opções - certo, médio e errado - não é nada demais. Você não fica ansioso para completar os desafios, mas na hora do beijo fica um sentimento recompensador. A transa só rola uma vez - não, ninguém aparece nu - e é tirada da cartola, só para dizer que colocaram uma.

O raciocínio em torno das alternativas não é lógico. Se você quer chegar a todas as respostas certas em um capítulo logo de cara, provavelmente não vai conseguir. É que os cards dizem uma coisa, mas o tom da ação pode ser diferente: uma opção aparentemente ofensiva se torna brincadeira quando o vídeo roda, e vice-versa.

Um segundo desafio, em paralelo, é o do complecionismo. Melhor arranjar um guia (tem aqui no Steam) e ir anotando os caminhos no papel até chegar aos 100% exploração. Há opções ocultas, que faz você repetir o capítulo várias vezes. Nesse vai-vém, percebem-se fragilidades, tornando a diversão cansativa. Por exemplo, torcemos para os insultos passarem rapidamente. Mas também tem as opções erradas em que o cara fica se mostrando, o que parece levar uma eternidade. E fica nessa repetição, assim como as perguntas baseadas em trabalho, lazer e viagens, parecendo um interrogatório, em determinada altura. De acordo com as estatísticas globais do Steam, pouquíssimos jogadores - por volta de 1% - resolveram ir até o final do jogo na data deste comentário.

A atuação é um ponto questionável. O protagonista, Richard La Ruina, consegue ser natural em muitos momentos e reproduzir um sorriso cativante. No humor, é exagerado, antecipa que vai fazê-lo e às vezes não consegue segurar a risada no curto momento entre a última fala e corte da gravação. Ele é menos engraçado do que acredita ser.

Entre as mulheres, muitas não têm o inglês como língua materna - os sotaques são evidentes - e algumas nem conseguem se expressar direito. O resultado é um comportamento robótico, dando a impressão de que estão lendo o texto, e não se envolvendo no papel. A atriz do primeiro capítulo, que aparece em outros dois, é simpática. A que lê Kafka é atraente, mas muito fria. A do parque e do último capítulo, esposa de Richard La Ruina na vida real, é fofinha, e só.

O capítulo na balada, com um abordagem entre dois casais, é o pior. Muito deprimente, com o amigo que aceita qualquer situação e as garotas sem graça. Por outro lado, a história no escritório é a melhor disparada, muito por causa da atriz (qual é o nome dela?), espirituosa e inteligente, criando momentos realmente engraçados. A personagem abandona o estereótipo de fêmea bobinha dos outros capítulos, botando Richard em seu devido lugar, quando necessários. As opções incorretas são as mais desconfortáveis, pois envolvem assédio sexual no trabalho.

Paralelamente, Richard comenta as escolhas do jogador. Ele está em uma cama, acompanhado de duas garotas. A do fundo é uma mosca morta. A da frente pelo menos dá uma risada aleatória em determinado momento. Tem hora que elas até somem: se cansaram ou não havia mais dinheiro para pagá-las. O fato é que a figuração delas é bem desnecessária.

O roteiro é problemático. O sucesso em criar vículos com desconhecidas em lugares públicos é inverossímil; você seria considerado um tarado em 99% das vezes. Em outras missões, o número de perguntas não parece insuficiente para chegar aos resultados desejados, se fosse na vida real. Mas essa é uma limitação do jogo.

Há conservadorismo ao retratar todas as garotas como ""belas e recatadas"", como se qualquer outro tipo fosse errado ou somente para ""diversão"". Na primeira metade, há até uma ofensa ao Brasil (e outra a Tailândia, no mesmo estilo), de aqui o sexo ser fácil, como se isso fosse um defeito ou todas as pessoas fossem assim. O moralismo é compartilhado tanto pelo homem quanto pelas mulheres. Em outra ocasião sobre viagens, tenta-se consertar isso em um comentário positivo.

Por outro lado, o estereótipo do homem perfeito é o de ser ""másculo"", seja lá o que isso signifique exatamente. Isso é citado por mais de uma personagem. Posteriormente, detalha-se externamente, sendo ""lenhador"" o estilo preferido por uma das mulheres. Muito clichê e restritivo.

O jogo é machista, sim. O homem está sentado com uma amiga, tomando café, e descreve uma mulher interessante na mesa ao lado da forma mais tarada possível. Mesmo sendo uma resposta média, o jogador passa tranquilamente por essa questão. Nos fracassos finais de vários capítulos, percebemos como um homem pode ser desagradável ao não saber receber um não, insistindo no sim, e isso assumindo caráter cômico. Não é engraçado.

Claro que como ""guia de sedução"", o game é um negócio fajuto. Não sei se os reveses servirão de aprendizado na vida real para os jogadores. Em vez de ""puxa, isso é algo que vai ofender as mulheres"", a interpretação pode ser ""não vou dar essa resposta porque sei que não funcionará"". Não vejo espaço para uma percepção humana, de se importar com o próximo genuinamente, nas escolhas. Essa virtude você vai ter que possuir previamente.

Talvez Super Seducer valha para quem estiver MUITO curioso e o desconto seja grande, mas não buscarei as continuações e, com esta experiência, voltaria no tempo e não compraria este jogo, se fosse possível.

Spiegelman etc.), Kafka and Burroughs novels, Escher illustrations,  pixel art and... 2D RPG!  Literally crazy! 

See here for a complete walkthrough (from stream 1 to stream 13): [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv0G7OlC7sI]You Tube[/url]

I found it not so much playable, but i'm not so accustomed to RPG and keyboard controls. It's not easy to understand what's happening here! Who your avatar is?  What's your mission? What's the story? I have no answers, sorry! At first, it seems completely no sense!
What have you to do? You can fight, use weapons, cast some spells, converse with strange beings, interact with weird objects and environments, etc. But gameplay is not the point. Aesthetics is the point! Play time is very very long: hours and hours of varied surreal situations, disturbing scenarios, weird characters, abstract drawings, absurd conversations, alienating soundtrack, etc. Graphics is not always pleasant, but its artistic value is out of  the question.

At first, the flux of psychedelic and surreal visions leaves you astonished and asking: what the f... is happening here? Then you realize to be in front of something unclassifiable, an artistic multimedia crossover.  While playing, I perceived a sense of alienation towards all life aspects. There are a lot of suggestions: procreation, technology, smartphones, TV,  weapons, job, religion, demons, esoterism, love, war, cancer, medicine, biology, death, communication and information, family,  etc. They are usually represented in a pessimistic and negative way, but there is also room for cinism, irony, sarcasm and.... philosophy... Yes, a bit of sophistry!

Probably WTCTR is too ambitious, pretentious and deliberately crazy, alternative and experimental as many contemporary artworks; you know: all that glitters is not gold; probably  content is not so deep as it would you to believe. It's art for art's sake, a sort of collage of  pre-existing artworks, perhaps not so expressive or genuinely inspired, but there is undoubtely a really hard, long and original job behind all such drawings and illustrations. Very impressive! I think there are no games like this, perhaps it's not only a game. It reminds me of experimental short films by Man Ray, Leger, Ruttman, Duchamp, etc. at the dawn of Cinema. That's not a matter of "" I like it"" or ""I don't like it"", may be the most of you will find it boring or ugly. The existence of such game is an added value, an enrichment for our beloved medium.

I think that the best comment is the following from the author of the game, John Clowder
<< This game is for the outsider aesthete, the outcast mutant, the curious observer, the subversive and those who can appreciate what others can’t—and those who don’t appreciate what others do. >>

Adventure game (quest/rpg hybrid) for those who enjoy surreal philosophical mindf*ckery (nerds?). But be ready for certain technical incompetence: fixed screen proportions & resolution, no overlay - pushing f12 instantly crashes the app.. which is real shame for there are tons of gorgeous visual content & lots of funny lines in writing (won't spoil much if I say that you will commit a suicide & meet the God himself face-to-face right in the first 5 mins). I think the experience here kinda constitutes 'art' as a communicative act, the product maybe subpar in usability but I can hear a living voice of a thinking creature, some original message, not another asset-flip.

The overall graphic style & animation conveys the dream-like state of mind the character is in, for he seems to travel through spirit world [i]bardo[/i]. Non-standard visual content: every screen is a surprise & not only in the sense of imagery used, but also in the ways the space being composed - screen geometry is subject for turning & bending, the character's body & activity develops through metamorphoses.  Story & dialogue feel like Dao-de-jing meets Franz Kafka. Intellectually competent, it intrigues my mind, quite differently from shallow graphomania of the regular shovelware.",54,english

I suppose a lot of the things that seem surreal or Kafka-esque will make more sense to me once I play the core Towards the Pantheon game in my Steam Library.

0,steam_reviews/70_Half-Life.json,88127,2,"Wonderful game, a must-play for those interested in the history of video games, or otherwise playing the games that fundamentally influenced game design in the games we love today.

Sci-fi, horror, humor, blood, and carnage, an oppressive futuristic atmosphere where democratic institutions have been fully subverted by corporations. A dystopia where national interest is inseparable from corporate, where the horror and hypocrisy of the system is craftily hidden behind layers of authoritative bureaucracy, Kafkaesque in nature, always ensuring to follow ""best practice and protocol"". 

Reminiscent of Fallout in this way, especially Vault-tec, but Black Mesa and the Gordon Freeman narrative provide more than could ever be considered derivative. Rather, derivative games look to Half-Life for pointers.  

Despite the great  story and the sheer influence this game had, it is a classic and let's be honest, there are some annoyances, particular in certain puzzles and in movement. While locales change enough to be interesting, the linearity of a 90s FPS/adventure game can wear tiresome as well.

So on normal difficulty it is not too hard, and the character stories are not that involved but overall it is a great game, stable, easy to love and a good overall campaign.

It feels very much like a Wasteland game and it wears Fallout isometric badges of honour all over - having enough difficult decisions to make you feel like you are having an impact if not providing a kafkaesque political overview of post apocalyptic life.

The graphics are good, the campaign took me 75+ hours of play and the only niggles I would say was there could have been more humour and party interplay, the weapons could have been a bit more different - it lost some of the worries of Wasteland 2 and ammo concerns and you again big guns and sub macs rule the day, but I am nitpicking, I really enjoyed the whole thing and will replay again.",18088,english

İlk önce 1.23 bedava içerik güncellemesine bir göz atalım.

Anadolu dahil Orta Asya, İran bölgesi,Kafkasya,Mısır-Irak bölgelerine baya bir bölge eklemişler tarihi çok daha gerçekci yansıtmak için harita düzenlenmiş baya.Artık hükümdarların, varislerin, hükümdar eşlerinin ve danışmanların kültürü ve dinini görebiliyorsunuz.Belki de en çok beğendiğim kısım yeni bir oyuna başlarken başladığımız ülke ile ilgili bir pencere geliyor ve bu ülkenin o an ki durumu ile ilgili tarihi bilgiler var hoş olmuş.1.23'te gözlemlediklerim şu anlık bu kadar dikkatimi çeken bir şey olursa düzenleyeceğim ileri zamanlarda.

Gelelim eklenti paketimize..

Eklenti paketi İslam dini ve İslam dinine mensup devletler için baya bir yenilik getirmiş.Sunni ve Şii mezhepleri için fıkıh mezhepleri seçebiliyoruz artık.Hanefi,Şafii,Maliki,Hanbeli,Caferi,Zahiri,İsmaili bu fıkıh mezheplerinden birini seçebiliyoruz ve bunların herbiri değişik bonuslar sağlıyor.Tabi seçmek için bazı şartları yerine getirmek gerekiyor.Müslüman ülkeler Mistisizm ve Kanunculuk arasında çeşitli bonuslar edinebiliyor.Yani ülkeniz ne kadar dindar veya ne kadar seküler bir yapıya sahipse bunlara göre değişik bonuslar alıyorsunuz.

İkta Vergisi: Müslüman devletler 20 yılda bir özel bonuslar sağlayan bir vergi çıkartabiliyor.

Danışmanlar eğer doğru dinden/kültürdense 5. seviyeye kadar terfi ettirilebiliyor.Tabi bunun için baya bir parayı gözden çıkarmak gerek.

Yeni Memlük yönetim biçimi de gelmiş.İlk oyunum kesinlikle Memlük ile olucak bu pakette.

Yeniçerileri artık direk basamıyorsunuz.Artık elit birimler.Özel olarak eyaletlerden çıkarmanız gerek.Manchu bannerleri gibi yani özel olarak çıkıyorlar ve disiplin moral bakımından baya güçlüler.İtiraf etmem gerek ki renklerine bayıldım çok güzel görünüyor.Ayriyeten artık Osmanlı ve Osmanlı hükümet sistemine sahip devletler eyaletlere paşa atayabiliyor.Bu paşalar o eyaletteki isyan riskini azaltıyorlar ve giderler azalıyor.Baya güzel olmuş bu özellik beğendim şahsen.Ama paşayı görevden almaya kalkarsanız sağlam bir isyana hazırlıklı olun.

Ordu Profesyonelliği mekaniği eklenmiş. Profesyonellik 0 ila 100 arası değişebiliyor.Gelen eventler,kararlar,politikalarınız olumlu veya negatif yönde etkiliyor ordu profesyoneliğini.Mümkünse düşük tutmayın bunu.Ordu Profesyonelliği seviyesine göre Supply Depot, Refill Garrison, insangücü kazanma, yarı fiyata general edinme gibi özelliklerden yararlanabiliyorsunuz.

Bir toprağınızın gelişmişlik seviyesini artık düşürebiliyoruz.Eskiden sadece Development artırabiliyorduk şu an bu Development'ı düşürme şansımız da var artık.Karşılığında dukat,manpower kazanıyoruz.

Bunların dışında farkettiğim küçük yenilikler de var.Mesela artık generallere isim verebiliyoruz.Küçültülmüş savaş sonuçları seçeneği gelmiş.Müslüman ülkeler artık başka ülkelerden alim çağırabiliyor.Vs vs..

31 TL verilecek bir dlc olmuş mu? Evet olmuş.Bazı arkadaşlar Paradox'un dlc politikasını eleştiriyor eleştirmekte haklılar elbet ama 2013'te çıkan bir oyunu hala bu denli güncel tutmaları harika bir şey.

0,steam_reviews/72900_WinterVoices.json,253,1,"[H1]Once upon a time, there was an unlucky girl.[/H1]
~Rule of Rose

[b]Steam[/b] library is full of hidden gems. And today, ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you about one of them. [b]Winter Voices[/b]. An episodic [b]RPG[/b] from a small team of talented [b]French[/b] people. By looking on screenshots, you, probably, already got some impressions about what this game may be, but let me tell you something – forget it. [b]Winter Voices[/b] is not what it seems ([b]Twin Peaks[/b] pun intended).

First of all, battles in this game... are not really battles. Even though they'll look a lot like our usual [b]TBS[/b] battles and there'll be a lot of various skills to learn, the “battles” here feel more like puzzles. Sounds weird and, well, it is. Even though I've finished thousands of games in my life, I don't think I remember anything like that. Your character will have proper [b]TBS[/b]-like stats, [b]HP[/b] and skills, but you'll rarely get a chance to directly attack your enemies and the goals will rarely ask you to kill something. Most of the time you'll need to avoid the enemies, or push them to achieve certain goals. Which can be tricky. To say the least. The “battles” may be pretty hard and confusing, but I ended up liking them a lot. Because of how challenging they were, because of how different they were and, of course, because of the story.

And that's where [b]Winter Voices[/b] shines for real. [i]The story[/i]. See, [b]Winter Voices[/b] is more than just a game. It's a [i]very[/i] serious, deep and complicated take on things like death, rape and denial. And also many other things that come with all that. Not only [b]Clara Lehenaff[/b] and Co carefully re-created a broken person's inner world, they've turned all that into an absolutely unique experience. [b]Winter Voices[/b] is full of metaphors and weird images that will probably take some time to fully understand. It's one of those games that will make you want to play them again just to get the better picture. It can be charming, it can be shocking and it's sure deep.

It's also slow. So, if you just fully completed [b]Super Meat Boy[/b] and your heart is still beating from all of those energy drinks you've swallowed on your way to victory, this game is [i]not[/i] for you. You'll just die from boredom. But if you've just finished with another book of [b]Jung[/b] and started re-reading [b]Kafka[/b] for fun again, then you should totally check this game out. It's [i]that[/i] kind of thing. And it's beautiful for what it is. Especially since it looks very charming and soundtrack is pretty nice too.

The problem is... this game was made by unexperienced people. And as the result, it's barely playable. Seriously, black screens, freezes and crashes are, like, the most common thing here. Wait until the end of hour-long battle, see the game getting the black screen, scream in agony, load your save file, repeat. That's how it works here. It can also be very confusing thanks to how English translation sucks. Just like that, it sucks. Hard. The goals in the game are confusing as is, so you can waste hours just to get the idea about what to do next, but English translation makes things even worse. Sometimes it's even hard to understand the meaning of the dialogue, it's [i]that[/i] bad. Finally, the game forces [b]Adobe AIR[/b] on you. Without even mentioning that on store page. Bad idea, guys. Bad, bad, [i]bad[/i] idea. I also must say that I didn't really like how developers treated those, who supported their game back in the days. I mean, back in the days, I've paid for all episodes. Now developers made their game free and [b]Clara[/b] says that she doesn't think there should be any rewards for those, who paid. Well, sorry, girl, but I disagree. When you take people's money, you reward them with something. Something small, something useless, but still [i]something[/i]. Give us an exclusive avatar, give us soundtrack (it's in the game folder anyway), give us a bunch of [b]Windows[/b] wallpapers, give us [i]something[/i]. You can't just say “[i]Boom! It's free now! Thanks for [strike]all the fish[/strike] your money, lol![/i]”. It just feels wrong and will make people to think twice before supporting your projects in the future.

[i]Anyway[/i], as you've probably already got, [b]Winter Voices[/b] is far from being ideal. Code-wise, it's a disaster. It's very confusing and it barely works. Your biggest enemy in this game is a poor coding. And trust me, it won't go easy on you. [i]But[/i] story and writing are so awesome that I'm ready to forgive everything. All those images from the broken mind and the struggle that damaged soul should overcome are so perfectly made that as a fellow writer all I can do is to applaud. I was heavily touched by [b]Winter Voices[/b] and I don't think I'll ever forget my experience here. So, in the end all I want to say is “[i]Thank you.[/i]”. Thank you to all those great people who worked on this little masterpiece. Thank you!",8000,english

0,steam_reviews/736260_BabaIsYou.json,17881,1,"Great game for people with a PhD in philosophy.

If you do not have a PhD then [u]do NOT buy this game[/u]. If you haven't spent hours upon hours researching dense academic material you won't be able to complete the first couple of levels. Without reading all of George Berkeley's works, how can you even begin to understand statements like ""Lava is more and hot"" coupled with mindblasters like ""Flag is melt and win"" and ""Baba is hot"". Esse is percipi (or for those monkeys that don't know basic Latin: to be is to be perceived) is crucial for at least a dozen levels of ""Baba Is You"". If you don't have a wide understanding of all the different philosophical schools of thought don't even bother reading the rest of this review. Nihilism is especially ingrained in the game's mechanics which is even evident in the likeness of the name ""Baba Is You"" to the Friedrich Nietzsche's famous line ""God is dead"". The ingenious ways that logical premises can be constructed and deconstructed only reassure the players that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities. After reading this you might still think you might give it a shot but didn't you learn in high school that things in themselves exist but their nature is unknowable? I smirk at those addlepated simpletons that bought this game without understanding the hermeneutic circle, struggling to apply knowledge from previous levels in the reference to the game as a whole. Without a PhD how would you even analyse this game from a meta perspective? Not in a million years would you think of realising this game is actually a beautiful existentialist work on par with works of Sartre, Kafka or Camus. Every level is a journey and at the end of each is a profound tautology.

0,steam_reviews/739630_Phasmophobia.json,559156,1,"Novellin nimi on Hiilisangolla ratsastaja. Sen on kirjoittanut Franz Kafka ja se on julkaistu kokoelmassa Kootut kertomukset vuonna 1920. Tekstin alalajina on absurdi novelli, koska tarinassa tapahtuu ihmeellisiä asioita ja Franz Kafka on tunnettu absurdeista teksteistään. Tarina kertoo köyhästä miehestä, joka tarvitsee hiiltä lämmittääkseen taloaan. Kirjoitelma on hieman alle aukeaman mittainen. 

Aikana ja paikkana on luultavasti Tšekkoslovakia 1900-luvun alussa talvella, koska hiiltä käytettiin talon lämmitykseen. Juoni on seuraavanlainen: Tarinan alussa päähenkilöllä on kylmä, koska hänellä ei ole hiiltä lämmittääkseen taloaan eikä rahaa ostaa sitä. Päähenkilö menee hiilikauppiaan luokse ratsastaen tyhjällä hiilisangolla toivoen, että tämä lainaisi hieman hiiltä uudestaan. Hiilikauppiaan vaimo häätää päähenkilön pois. Tarina päättyy siihen, että päähenkilö jää ulos vihaisena ja kylmissään, sekä mahdollisesti kuolee.

Päähenkilö on köyhä ja tarvitsee hiiltä kipeästi. Kyseessä ei ole ensimmäinen kerta. “Tavanomaisia pyyntöjäni kohtaan hän on kuitenkin turtunut”. Päähenkilön ikää ei mainita, mutta hiilikauppias mainitsee kuulevansa “vanhan asiakkaan”.
Tarina kerrotaan päähenkilön silmin. Sivuhenkilöitä ovat hiilikauppias sekä hänen vaimonsa. Kertojana on minäkertoja ja samalla päähenkilö. Fokalisaatio on sisäistä. “Minä täällä; vanha asiakas; nöyrä ja uskollinen; vain tilapäisesti varattomana”. Tunnelma on unenomainen ja hieman ahdistava loppua kohden.

Hiilikauppiaan vaimolla on erityisen negatiivinen suhde päähenkilöön. Vaimo ei ollut kuulevinaan päähenkilöä ollenkaan ja suorastaan hylki tätä ilman armoa. Hiilikauppias olisi kuunnellut päähenkilön ehdotusta ja oli menossa jo ulos, mutta vaimo tuli estämään häntä. Hiilikauppias on tehnyt aikaisemminkin kauppaa päähenkilön kanssa ja tuntee päähenkilön luultavasti hyvin. “Vanha; hyvin vanha asiakas varmaan, joka osaa puhua minulle niin sydämeenkäyvästi”.

Päähenkilön motiivina on hiilen tarve, jotta tämä ei jäädy kylmässä talvessa. Tämä ajaa tarinaa eteenpäin ja saa päähenkilön kauppiaan luokse. Loppujen lopuksi hiilenpuute johtaa oletettavasti päähenkilön kuolemaan. Hiilikauppiaan vaimon motiivi päähenkilön hylkäämiselle voi olla oma hyvä elämäntilanne. Koska kauppiaalla ja vaimolla on kaikki hyvin ja päähenkilöllä ei, tämä pitää päähenkilöä alempiarvoisena ja syrjii tätä sen takia. “Sinä paha nainen, huudan vielä takaisin; samalla kun hän liikkeeseen päin kääntyen puolittain halveksivasti, puolittain tyytyväisenä heilauttaa kättään, sinä paha nainen!” Toinen mahdollinen motiivi vaimon toiminnalle voisi olla se, kuinka kauppias on jo aiemmin lainannut hiiltä päähenkilölle. Päähenkilö on tuskin maksanut aikaisempiakaan hiiliä takaisin. Vaimo ei pidä kauppiaan sinisilmäisyydestä.
Teema voi olla henkilöiden välinen konflikti, joka johtuu heistä riippumattomista tekijöistä, kuten eriarvoisuudesta. Päähenkilö on köyhä, kylmissään ja mahdollisesti kuolee, kun taas hiilikauppias ja tämän vaimo ovat rikkaita, lämpimässä ja oletettavasti jatkavat elämäänsä onnellisena tekstin päättyessä. Hiili kuvastaa elämää päähenkilölle, koska ilman tätä hän kuolee kylmyyteen. Hiilikauppiaalle ja tämän vaimolle hiili on vain kauppatavaraa. Viimeinen virke “Ja niin kohoan jäävuorten ilmakerroksiin ja katoan koskaan enää palaamatta” voi olla jopa päähenkilön kuolema.

Franz Kafka on mahdollisesti itse kokenut tai nähnyt novellissa tapahtuvaa syrjintää ensimmäisen maailmansodan jälkeisessä Tšekkoslovakiassa. Alue kuului pitkään Itävalta-Unkarille, jossa oli suuria eroja monien eri ihmisten ja kansojen välillä. On erittäin mahdollista, että novellin juonta vastaavia asioita on tapahtunut yleisesti. Kuoleman käsitykseen tekstissä voi vaikuttaa Kafkan juutalainen tausta. Juutalaisuudessa kuoleman jälkeen sielu palaa Jumalan luokse.

0,steam_reviews/743390_DISTRAINT2.json,3398,1,"Thank you, Jesse Makkonen, for channeling whatever trauma you've been through and overcome into creating this beautiful game (and for your wonderful response to my email to you). Distraint 2 has all the Kafkaesque weirdness & horror of the first but so much more emotional depth; it is a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance, a beacon of hope in a cynical, indifferent world that gives us no shortage of reasons to want to leave it prematurely. I finished this game in a single three hour session, and the story resonated so deeply with me that by the ending, I was in tears. There aren't a lot of games about which I can say the same.

The game itself is a heavily stylized art house piece with a very narrow aspect ratio, retro-style graphics & audio (including a good original soundtrack), and 2D sidescrolling that is very dialogue-heavy with a few puzzles (not as many or as challenging as the first game, but that better suits its pacing); however, all of this is secondary to the story it tells and the arc of Casey Price, the returning lead character from Distraint. This is an amazing sequel, but also quite brilliant in its own right - those who haven't played the first can jump into this and have enough context and understanding of the backstory to enjoy it, though I highly recommend playing the two games in order. This one will stick with me for quite some time.",179,english
0,steam_reviews/753640_OuterWilds.json,49854,1,"Well...  I fell for the hype and I wish I hadn't. I thought for sure I would love this game. Maybe I'm just not in the right mood. Maybe I just haven't gotten far enough. Maybe I'm not as easily impressed as an awful lot of people, I don't know. But if I could sum up my experience so far in one word, it would be ""tedious.""

Don't get me wrong, the game was charming as hell at first. The tutorial section where you walk around and chat with your fellow Oddworld knockoffs, roast marshmallows and mess around with gadgets and gravity mechanics was pretty neat. Then I went to space and the game introduced me to two central themes that completely shat all over the experience: space is really, REALLY small, and you are going to die over and over and over again, often for absolutely no reason. Trying to figure out a way to get around? Here comes a bright light! And every time you die, you have to go run back to your ship and take off again and go find the place where you were, and dear god it's a waste of time.

This mechanic is almost EXACTLY like any game where you go to jail for committing a crime and wake up in a cell after your sentence is over, except imagine the laws are alien and Kafkaesque. Someone bumps into you randomly and it's a crime, you get turned around and walk into a building and it's a crime, you talk to the wrong person and it's a crime. It's the same mindless drill and repeat I can't stand about roguelikes. I was hoping maybe there was a decent story hook, but no, it's just ""hey go off to space, these other guys you neither know nor care about are out there somewhere."" 

Other reviews want to convince you this game is about exploration. It's not. You have neither the space nor the time to get any real exploration in. This is a first-person physics platformer with intermittent and jarring interruptions. If you like doing the exact same thing over and over and over again, well... uh... enjoy!! Me? I'll go do something else thank you.",115,english

Additional Tags: Archived

TLDR: Beholder 2 is a great improvement over the original. Suffers from mobile oriented controls, difficult to parse hotspots, a cryptic game world and game mechanics and a slow gameplay loop.

Outstanding issues:
-Is an adventure game that, when it is played on desktop, wants you to use tank controls/wasd
Mouseclicks only allows minor movement forward, the character routinely switches from run to walk speed, the constant reclicking can be fatiguing and the process is much too cumbersome to navigate even tiny lateral corridors. 
Playing an adventure game where you navigate through wasd but still need the mice to interact with objects makes it a significant downgrade from the tap interface this was obviously designed around.

-Little exploration is possible and within those small environments choices are unclear
Beholder 2 revolves around a daily-activity structure. In which you will revisit familiar areas, while the local population might be different, objects might had been moved. The game relies on the player managing an action economy. In that talking with NPCS, working your job etc will consume the ""time"" asset supplied at the beginning of the day and without advance knowledge of which hotspots unlock which branching path, which offer a choice that goes against the ""ethical/roleplay"" direction you want your character to take, and which are just witty fluff text meant to add body to the game world it becomes just a random and unsatisfying guessing game to click on said hotspots and lowers immerssion

-Odd in-game culture. Bland. Odd mechanically.
Which departments, which offices, which forms, which faction, who to trust, is not intuitive. It is possible to gather some information by being slow and methodical with the npcs and perhaps replaying the game. However the game tone initially starts as ""generic orwellian with a dash of kafka"". The heavy use of black and white, the samey looking character models and the nice but heavily recycled audio makes it less of a sensory or intellectual treat to go through the game at a slow pace or experiment with the mechanics in a trial and error manner.

-Fun in small bursts
While it is an alright distraction to follow the narrative, the quest chains, to make simple choices and see the story unravel, it does become a bit of a slog to do it repeatedly. Running left, doing a thing, being told to go speak to someone, whom you not know the location of, running right in the hope of finding them, wondering if you should ""waste time"" on talking to other npcs on the way.... Its okay but its not the kind of experience I'd actually ever want to stop everything im doing for, pull up the computer chair, sit down with a warm drink, and do for hours. 

Positives:
+Much better structured and presented than Beholder1 which had a stricter ""spinning plates"" action economy and clunkier overall engine and thinner narrative
+Would be fun to whip up on a tablet when stuck bored somewhere, especially as a cheeky way to ""stick it to the man"" when stuck at a government office or waiting in some waiting room somewhere. 
+Seemed to boot correctly, displayed correctly at 4k. Had its own style, charm, and writing quality and seemed to have an identity of its own. Bland at first but the ""mystery"" and ""factions"" aspect of the narrative had me a little intrigued

Conclusion: While I am not very keen on playing this at this time, it could be that I am not in the right mindset currently, or maybe I just need to watch a lets play of someone else who knows how this game is played first. 

I feel ... extremely untalented at doing anything in this game. My actions feel... random. The results I get from it are miffed, little cash, little ""authority"" rewards, my roleplay choices already seem to contradict themselves and im only at the beginning of the game. Once I had a firmer grasp on how this game handles maybe I would actually enjoy it quite a bit more. 

Unfortunately I do not own a tablet, and I am reviewing the desktop version which also really does hinder the potential I see in this game given how it has been executed. I do see that it has been made with some level of care, it goes on extreme sales often if you do not mind the controls and want that kind of flavor and either are interested in the mechanics or want to figure them out. It could be ""recommendable"" for you. 

The outright lack of ""fun factor"", the pacing... there are too many elements here that de-incentivize me from playing and I think many other gamers might feel the same. I will however keep my copy in the hidden library for potential future use and perhaps the sequel, Beholder 3 will a better overall product. If it is superior in all the ways maybe I would discard this in favor of an even better executer third entry. After all, if the devs made this much progress in one sequel the latest in the trilogy could prove very entertaining.

The form processing part - similar to Papers, Please - is also not always clear as to how to arrive at the correct answer.

One minute I am having a blast, talking to a new bean that has come into my life, sharing the same experiences on the battlefield. Serious bonding occurs in this game, unlike any other game i've played or any other thing that has happened in my life. Sometimes I find myself in a daze, running off to my little bean world. But it is not without it's pathological nature. 

One moment, you are transported into this bean world with the highest level of ambition, only to be absolutely decimated; reduced to nothing, stuck in a kafkaesque nightmarish hell of racial slurs and emotionally abusive legume characters, wanting nothing less than to reduce me to nothing. It is not uncommon for my tears to spill atop my dirty keyboard, haunted by the enemies I have made through this unforgiving push-pull between the highest level of kindness, and the deepest forms of pure evil.

0,steam_reviews/7940_CallofDuty4ModernWarfare2007.json,20720,1,"FPS türünü baştan tanımlayan oyun. Modern Warfare serisinin ilk, Call of Duty serisinin 4. oyunu. Oyun tarihinin gelmiş geçmiş en iyi 10 görevine rahatlıkla girecek görevler barındıran, insanı aksiyona fazlasıyla doyuran, Captain Price isimli çoğu oyuncuya manevi baba olarak gelen bir karakteri oyun dünyasına kazandıran o oyun: Karşınızda Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare 
📖HİKAYE📖: Hikayesi klasik Amerikan propagandası. Bazı Amerikan askerlerinin dünyayı acımasız Ruslardan koruması, kısaca bu. John ""Soap"" MacTavish adlı İngiliz asker, SAS birliğine katılmıştır ve bu birlikte Gas, Captain Price gibi başka askerler bulunmaktadır. Soap ekibe katıldığı esnada Rusya'da hükumet ile aşırı sağcılar arasında iç savaş yaşanmaktadır ve Suudi Arabistan'da Al Asad isimli bir adam ülke başkanını öldürüp diktatör olmuştur. Aşırı sağcı Rusların lideri, Captain Price'ın oyunun geçtiği yıldan 15 yıl önce 900 metreden sniper ile vurduğu ama öldüremeyip kolunu kaybetmesine neden olduğu Imran Zakhaev'dir. Amerikan ve İngiliz ordusu, Al Asad isimli diktatörü düşürmek için Arap Yarımadası'na ve Zakhaev'in elindeki nükleer füzelerin ABD'ye ateşlenmesine engel olmak için Kafkaslar'a girmişlerdir. Hikaye, ana karakterlerin Imran Zakhaev ve Al Asad'ı durdurmaya çalışmasıyla geçmektedir. Karakterlerle sürekli sırt sırta savaştığımızdan onlara bağlanıyoruz ve isimleri unutulmamak üzere aklımıza kazınıyor. Etkileyici  ve akıcı bir hikayesi var, çok beğendim.
⏳OYNANIŞ SÜRESİ⏳: Ana hikayeyi 5 saatte bitirdim, yani 6 saat civarı bir oynanış süresi var diyebiliriz. Online oynarsanız bu süre sınırsız olur ama online oynayan kalmış mıdır bilemem.
⚔OYNANIŞ⚔: Oynanış sürekli düşmanları yok edip ilerlemekten ibaret. Peki bu düşmanları nerede ve nasıl yok ediyoruz?  Oyun tarihinin en iyi 10 görevinden biri olan ve gizlilik ile ilerleyip suikast yapmaya dayalı olan Pripyat görevi, hareketli bir aracın içinde düşmanlar tarafından kovalanma görevi, helikopterden yere ateş etme görevi, düşmanları 25, 40 veya 105 milimetrelik silahların bulunduğu bir hava aracıyla yok edip karadaki birimlere destek verme görevi, birini esir alma görevi, tank yok etme görevi, esir alınan birini kurtarma görevi vb. pek çok görev var. Yaptığımız bu görevleri Kafkaslar ve Arap Yarımadası'nda yapıyoruz. Bir görevi Soap MacTavish ile Kafkaslarda, bir görevi Paul Jackson ile Arap Yarımadasında yapıyoruz yani sırayla bir Arap Yarımadası'nda bir de Kafkaslar'da görev yapıyoruz, atmosfer sürekli değişiyor. Çölün ortasındaki bir yerde adam vuruyorsunuz, görev bitiyor, sonra çok detaylı hazırlanmış bir geçişten sonra bir anda Rusya'da bir görev başlıyor falan yani ortam değişimleri mükemmel. Bunun gibi birçok farklı görevi pek çok farklı yerde yapıyoruz yani oyun size hiçbir zaman sürekli aynı yerde şeyi yapıyormuşsunuz hissini vermiyor. Vuruş hissiyatı çok iyi ve bunun Call of Duty 4: MW'nin eskimemesinin en önemli yanı olduğunu düşünüyorum, oyun boyunca sürekli yaptığımız şey tatminkar hissettirmese ne olurdu düşünebiliyor musunuz? Bu tatminkarlık bu oyunu hâlâ severek oynatıyor. Kendinizi oyunun bir FPS oyunu olması, her görevden önce yapılan telefon veya telsiz konuşmaları, kullanacağınız silah veya silahlarının planlarının animasyonlu olarak gösterilmesi, savaştığınız yerde kaçışan siviller ile ölen silah arkadaşlarınızla orada bir savaş olduğunun iyice hissettirilmesi gibi pek çok etkenle oyunun içinde hissediyorsunuz. 5 saatlik oynayış sürem boyunca hiçbir yavaşlık veya kopukluk hissetmedim, tek oturuşta dümdüz bir aksiyonla oyunu bitirdim. Oynanış 10 numara ama 13-15 Call of Duty oyunu aynı bu oynanışa sahip şekilde çıkmasaydı güzel olurdu, sürekli aynı şekilde oyunlar yapıla yapıla Call of Duty'nin boku çıkarılmış.
🎵MÜZİKLER🎵: Oyunun kesintisiz aksiyonuna uygun müzikler var, kendinizi oyunun içindeymiş gibi hissetmenizi sağlayacak kadar iyi.
💻OPTİMİZASYON💻: 14 yıllık bir oyun, 200-300 FPS ile oynadım. Çoğu bilgisayarda çalışır.
📊GRAFİKLER📊: 2007 yılına göre çok iyi olsa da günümüzde göze eskimiş geliyor ama gideri var, henüz göze fosil gibi gelmiyor.
💸FİYAT💸: Asla 14 yıllık oyunu indirim olunca 25 liraya satan Activision kadar paragöz olmayın. Bu fiyat ne lan dalga mı geçiyorsun? Sırf fiyatı fazla bulduğumdan MW serisini oynamam en az 1 yıl gecikti.
❗SONUÇ❗: Bu oyun, FPS türünün yeniden tanımlanmasını sağlayan bir başyapıttır. Çok iyi, çok akıcı oyun. Fiyatı 14 yıllık bir oyuna göre gereksiz pahalı olsa da oyunu aldığınızda pişman olmuyorsunuz. Bu tür düzgün hikayesi olan Call of Duty oyunlarına neden özlem duyulduğunu bu oyunu oynadıktan sonra çok iyi oynadım: Black Ops gibi Call of Duty oyunlarında ruh yok.",295,turkish
0,steam_reviews/796370_DesertofVice.json,17,2,"Desert of Vice is a horror text adventure game with inspiration of Zork, Lovecraft and even some Kafka.

While the game is not completly text-based, as it got both visual design and soundtrack, the gameplay is pure text where the game responds to your input. Just like in the olden days of adventure games!

The game has an interesting storyline which doesn't tell you everything in the beginning, instead it lets you explore and find out things on your own. There are some hints, but most of the time you're left to yourself, your keyboard and the desert. There's also multiple endings which gives the game some replayability, especially since you're offered a lot of variation in doing things.

The amount of possible commands is very limited and inconsistent. When used it'll expect exact input by the player. Do not expect a dictionary of synonyms. This also means that world building and exploration are *very* limited. This means that rather than a text adventure, it's more of an interactive novel. In this case though, it kinda works because of its Kafka-esque tone. Keep this in mind, and it's an enjoyable trip.",89,english

I began to build my civilization, carefully selecting each and every unit and structure with the utmost precision. But as I progressed through the ages, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Everything seemed to be going according to plan, but then, out of nowhere, my units began to act on their own accord. They seemed to have a will of their own, and I was powerless to stop them.

I watched in horror as my once-great civilization crumbled before my very eyes, the units I had so carefully nurtured turning against me in a frenzied, irrational frenzy.

It was as if the game itself were a living, breathing entity, taunting me with its absurdity and mocking my every move.

0,steam_reviews/842100_Daymare1998.json,2936,1,"I got it on the current sale, 60% off of $30($12) and no.

The very, very, very core gameplay is there. The story is an interesting premise: A Japanese submarine with a revenge weapon is set to unleash its cargo on America after the nuclear bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Something happens and it founders, failing to deliver its deadly cargo right outside the PNW.

Everything else is a problem.

Silent Hill is a great game, but its so memorable in part because it was a foreign team giving their take on American culture. They studied that culture very hard in order to emulate American society and what it would look like. This team did not take the same care. In fact i would say they almost completely ignored most sources on American society in their pursuit of finishing this game. It feels like they heard about America through rumors and hearsay reproduced in popular culture and made into a cultural trope. Then the footage was poorly copied and dubbed into another language. The areas of this game where its supposed to be a smaller sized American city are schizophrenic. They feel more like the layout of a city from a Kafka-esque nightmare than a real place people would live. They also feel very European. Not that thats a bad thing, but the difference is both obvious and distracting. The streets are covered in weird grafitti and references. Most of them are at least period accurate(""Kuato Lives"",  ""No Fate"", etc.) but then they literally copy and paste the cardboard cutout of Little Suzy from the MIB movie. Its just there, on a wall. Its just bad. The whole city is like this and its incredibly distracting, especially when you see multiple posters for the same thing around every corner, and they're just memes. Its not like an actual poster you would find pasted on a brick wall in a city. And almost all of these memes and references are achievements. Press 'F' on a Scream Poster for an achievement. This isn't even mentioning that one chapter starts you out in the studio they were working in. Its not like a secret room or whatever, its just a place you start in after Things Have Gone Bad.

The actual gameplay is probably worse in general. Lets start:

Menuing: this is absolutely atrocious. They get points for having an interesting diagetic menu system, but they lose them all and more for the sheer navigational portions of it. It takes seconds for the menu to pop up. Seconds. This is the only survival horror game that I know of, with an inventory system ALA RE1, etc, that takes this fucking long to get into. Dead Space did this right the first time, and they did it right over a decade before this game released. Embarrassing to be this far behind the curve.

Combat: Generally its acceptable. Its just also very dull. I didn't play in Nightmare mode because if I wanted to manage my ammunition and magazines I'd play Escape from Tarkov(I would argue the better horror game). Its a very limited experience that they were assuming would get by with the inventory management making it difficult. There are no standout weapons, no grenades, nothing except a handgun in different models, a shotgun that both of the mains carry, an SMG that the first guy you play as has(that is essentially just the pistol but with the benefits of better handling and stability), and a Magnum, in Revolver and Juan Deag varieties. There are two main characters you play as, Raven and Sam, the only difference between them being that Sam sometimes sees things that aren't there because he was medically experimented on in the womb. Which really just means sometimes you'll shoot a monster and it'll fade away into red mist, mercifully saving you the second bullet. Liev is the third character you play as, and he has the SMG, but it doesn't matter.

There are 4 total zombies types in this game: the traditional RE zombie, the tough guy, the tough guy that spits acid, and the crack zombie with a glowing weakpoint. None of this is challenging. Which is why the devs constantly put the 1st type of zombie around corners you can't check, so they can cheaply get a hit in. I never had an issue with an enemy as long as I saw them before I got into hugging range.  The problems begin when you get into the Boss. Liev(spoilers) is the first Boss you fight and Jesus they do not tell you what you need to do to kill him. After a ten minute combat encounter, I beat him but also wasting most of the ammunition I brought, and only being compensated with handgun rounds which did almost nothing to the boss. Then I quit when the next section started to leave this review. You now have to run away from Liev, get to the chopper, all that jazz. Liev gets a brand new attack that OHKs from a ridiculous range. You are in a tight space, waiting for an elevator, dodging around, and stunning him with environmental traps. Its bullshit. Its annoying. It wastes my time and I've wasted 13 hours here already. Its not tense, because its not like I can dodge the attack or I can stun him with a flash bang or otherwise save my ass. Considering the Nightmare mode slows movement this thing has to fucking suck the shit all the way out of your ass.

Puzzles: I liked the puzzles, but honestly there is a good reason why they all can be skipped without penalty. If you aren't patient or don't feel like reading the reams and reams of text in this game, you won't enjoy it.

Story: This game's story is essentially a fast forward of RE 1-3: big pharma corp takes over a town, something goes wrong in a remote location, that thing causes Zombies. The backstory of why this is all happening mostly gets relayed to you the player through notes, but these notes are like, at a minimum 2 pages long. You will know so much fake shit about this little town at the end of this game if you spend the time to read it.

The ARG Website: I'm not calling this a real ARG, but I have to single this out because holy shit this website is running HTTP in the year of our lord 2022. I really hope this is just you guys being clever and this website is actually launched from a server you spin up on my computer and you just have me navigate to it, because otherwise this shit is inexcusable. Whats even more inexcusable is the fact that most of the documents on this site are only on this site to be on the site. What does this mean? When you pick up one of these documents it gives you a code you need to enter on the website and the name of the website. WE DO NOT NEED THIS SHIT JUST LET US READ. Most of the information relayed to you this way is useless anyways. It doesn't tell you anything that helps you in game.

Summary: an ambitious attempt that shoots for the STARS and barely manages to crash itself into an apartment skylight to avoid death. I'd say this would be okay at like $5. I'd give this game more respect if it didn't feel like it was cheaply cobbled together. Sam, one of the main characters, looks like one of the porn game models in the slideshow for your average porn star game on here. Raven looks like the guy from that Half-Life game that one guy conned Valve into allowing him to make. The developers didn't put care into this game. Instead they removed most of the long hair and other similar objects because they never got the physics right for the animation. Seriously, almost all of the women in this game are bald because they knew it looked like shit to have the hair on but didn't know how to fix it. There are so many little details like this that make this game feel like boring shit.",826,english
0,steam_reviews/845070_TheAwesomeAdventuresofCaptainSpirit.json,12925,1,"This story was honestly nothing but depressing. Is this what millennials like or something? This kid's life is horrible. Abused kid with a dead mom and an alcoholic dad simulator? 

I fired this up with my 3 year old kid, thinking it was going to be some lighthearted, sweet game about the innocence and fun of childhood. First the dad drops the F bomb, then the kid has ""get over here, b***h"" bruises on his arm. I told my kid that the game was over. 

I'll give it credit for being compelling and good storytelling, as I obviously turned it back on later when my kid wasn't around, but the story itself is just sad. Screwing with people's emotions isn't a basis for a story. There was no overarching theme. I just felt a mix between being terrified of my dad (who in his defense, has a problem) and sad. 

Like I said, good storytelling, but a bad story. There is a difference. Very millennial. I guess I'm not the audience. Ya'll just like to be depressed all the time or what?

[h1]Seul (Alone): The entrée[/h1]
A philosophically fueled choose your own nightmare like novella. There is some pretty grim material within the readings. Strap on your David Lynch, Kafka, and other surrealism enjoyments hats because this one will be for you if you enjoy those artists and can handle dark subjects. The story is a part of a past and continual project series. The past game can played [url=https://paranormalgames.itch.io/seul-alone-the-day-before]here[/url] for free. The future projects will continue to unfold the story.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
This title is essentially a novella. You read by panning the screen and make decisions. That's pretty much all there is to it. There is a nice amount of branching from the decisions. You can find your demise or an abrupt end to the story by choosing the wrong decision. The decisions seem to branch you back on a regular route eventually but there is a nice amount of content to read. About the only thing that sometimes bothered me is when I would click a decision and it would jump to halfway down the next section to read. 

[h1]Artistic Presentation[/h1]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498457202
The game can be read in two formats. There is a light mode and a dark mode. Both modes are similar to the title screens from silent films. The images in the game are from open source and public domain sites but they find a way to go along with the most notable factor of this experience which is the reading. I found the read and dialogue to be very well written and worth the time. There will be many that won't get everything that is happening because it does hinge heavily on philosophy and other matters of deep thought.  The music is a jarring mix of white noise, old records, and other various ambient noises. There is sometimes a strange juxtaposition to what you are reading but it works pretty well with the surrealism of it all. 

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
I enjoyed reading this and am curious to see where it goes. I think before buying this title you should first look into the free prequel game mentioned above. They have the same type of format and can give you an idea if you will enjoy the material. The longest route I have found took me about 38 minutes to read. It seemed like a normal route ending with comments about the next projects.

J'ai vu quelques personnes un peu déçues de leur expérience et c'est parce qu'on ne sait pas trop à quoi s'attendre en achetant Void Bastards alors je vais vous faire un petit topo rapide. 

[h1] Contient des traces de : [/h1]
Bon, d'abord ça mélange rogue-lite et FPS mais même avec ça, c'est difficile de savoir à quoi s'attendre puisqu'il y a plusieurs façons de réaliser chacun de ce genre de jeux.
Pour ce qui est de l'aspect tir à la première personne on est, comme certaines personnes l'ont très justement exprimé, loin de la nervosité des classiques du genre. Il est plus question ici de planifier avec soin son entrée sur chaque vaisseau en choisissant un flingue, une arme à dommages indirects et un outil en fonction des données à notre disposition et des quantités de munitions qu'il nous reste. 

Si ça paraît un peu simpliste, vous vous direz très vite des choses telles que ""Ha ! il faut que je trouve un vaisseau pour ramasser tel types de munitions"" ou ""Je vais éviter ce vaisseau parce que j'ai plus d'explosifs"". Et donc vous serez amené à faire des choix qui influenceront chacune de vos runs. 

L'aspect rogue-lite est... présent. Il n'a rien de novateur mais il fait son travail honnêtement ; chaque nouveau personnage arrive avec un à deux ""traits"" qui peuvent aller du handicap super pénible (la vision tunnel purée...) au gros bonus, en passant par des petits atouts ou contraintes plutôt bien fichus. 
Ensuite viendra le moment de se jeter dans la nébuleuse pour progresser dans l'intrigue (dont je ne parlerai pas mais qui est teintée d'un humour un peu cynique et kafkaïen comme j'aime). 

Cette nébuleuse c'est un sacré dépotoir et plutôt que de générer procéduralement une carte injuste, Void Bastards propose le tour de passe-passe suivant pour vous donner une sensation de découverte constante : Il y a plusieurs types de vaisseau ; navires de croisière, hôpîtaux, etc... qui correspondent aux différents types de matériaux qu'on trouve dessus (classiquement on trouvera de la nourriture sur les vaisseaux de croisière et des seringues pour vos armes sur les vaisseaux-ambulance). Mais tout le reste est aléatoire : parfois ils sont en feu, d'autres ils abritent un boss un peu coriace, une pièce de craft intéressante... 
En fonction de votre arsenal, de vos réserves de carburant, de torpilles, de nourriture, vous ferez les choix qui s'imposent pour ne pas vous faire avaler par une baleine du néant ou atteindre une destination essentielle. 

J'avoue que le rogue-lite c'est pas spécialement mon genre de prédilection mais j'ai beaucoup aimé Void Bastards parce que je le trouve peu punitif, parce qu'il a une ambiance, un style graphique et un humour un peu décalés mais aussi parce qu'il m'a poussé à apprendre à battre en retraite pour ne pas mourir bêtement.",1848,french

[b]Radiant One[/b] is a story-focused point and click adventure with a couple of quick time events.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Stylish graphics
+ Dreamy yet unsettling atmosphere

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Boring gameplay
- Story ends abruptly
- Too short (around 40 minutes)

[h1]Story[/h1] 
You play as [b]Daniel[/b] a middle-aged man whose life consists of two things: work and sleep. He tries to learn lucid dreaming to make the most of his second favorite thing. As he masters this ability, his dreams become scarier and harder to distinguish from reality. Until one day they turn into real nightmares that he’ll have to escape in order to survive. While the premise sounds interesting and has all the potential needed to build a dramatic story dealing with phobias and traumas, it all comes down to the most boring conclusion imaginable. Because of that it feels unfinished like it’s just the first part of the story, sadly not.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It’s your usual point and click, but without pixel hunting and with a couple of QTEs thrown in. You just walk around and click on things to learn a bit more about them, there aren’t any puzzles to solve, just find the right object to click on and that’s it. There are chase sequences where you have to run from the nightmarish creature and do some QTEs while you’re at it. They work well to build up the tension, but feel very short and unimaginative.

[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]
The only thing done right in this game is its’ visual and audio design. Although it looks very simple with low polygonal models, flat textures and simple animations, it has a certain style to it, that makes it all fit together and create a beautiful picture. Music and sounds are also doing a fine job to create an unsettling dreamy atmosphere.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
Specs: Intel Core i5-7300HQ, 12GB RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1050 4GB.

The game runs at steady 60 FPS on high settings at 1080p without any technical issues.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you like short story-focused games, you should give it a pass. Instead pick up one of these fine games, that I've reviewed previously: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/sirozha/recommended/1102130/]Florence[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/sirozha/recommended/875310/]Liberated[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/sirozha/recommended/392280/]The Franz Kafka Videogame[/url].

0,steam_reviews/864610_MagicRealmOnline.json,50,1,"EDIT: I have changed my recommendation due to developer response.

A rating of ""mixed"" is eerily accurate if a bit generous. There is a lot to like here, and the game may have worked better at some point, but today, on 1/20/2020 the game has enough critically breaking bugs that downgrade it from ""game"" to ""alpha prototype"". It is absolutely impossible to progress in the game after unlocking 2 characters. 

You can see at the time I am posting this review I have 26 hours on record. Why did I play a alpha prototype for 26 hrs? Well it all started when my friend and I were looking for a casual co-op VR game and this seemed to fit the bill. Everything started well enough, but soon things started getting weird. I became interested in the weird bugs enough to basically hunt them all down as a vigilante beta tester. 

For the developer, in short order, here are the bugs:
1. Bombs from the shop in multiplayer cost ""double"". As in they cost 1000 to buy, but when you use one another 1000 is taken away from you. If you don't have 1000 when you use it, you actually go into negative money. If you have 5000 gold, buy 5 bombs, you'll be at 0 gold. Then if you throw 5 bombs, you'll be at -5000 gold. You actually have to repay this negative balance before earning gold again. This is the only item that behaves like this in the game, and it seems like only in multiplayer mode. 
2. Giants in ""Standard"" mode are 10x harder than the giants in ""Master"" mode. This makes no sense. Maybe they are switched, but I think there are a few extra 0s at the end of the hp for the Standard giants. It takes about 6 bombs to kill one. In contrast, one bomb and a few attacks kills a Master giant. 
3. Joining multiplayer always sends you back to the title screen. For some reason if both my friend and I close steam and re-open, multiplayer works. Happens everytime. 


Now for potential buyers, let me explain why these seemingly simple bugs that could have been the result of a single typo in the code, and could be fixed just as easily; turn this game into a kafkaeque nightmare. 

There are 2 difficulty modes, standard and master. In multiplayer, both standard and master are slightly harder. 

A variety of unique and interesting mobs spawn from the gates and you must take them down before they reach your castle gate. On waves 10,15,20,25,30 and then more frequently from then on, special giant ""boss"" mobs spawn. On Standard difficulty, they have an impossibly high hp. You can play a perfect game, and use all your gold and might and you will only be able to kill 1. On wave 20, 2 giants spawn and there is no way you are getting past that. 

Luckily there is ""Master"" mode, which claims to be harder, but is actually easier. On master mode the normal mobs have more hp but it is manageable. The giants however are surprisingly very easy to deal with! I estimate they have 7-10 times less hp than the ones in standard mode. I was able to get to wave ~40 in singleplayer on Master. 

But I got this game to play with my friend, and this is where the last straw happens. To kill the giants you need to use a bomb item you can buy from the shop, with gold earned for killing mobs. 
For whatever reason, in multiplayer mode, using the bomb item depletes a large amount of your gold. It will even send your gold amount into the negative, which you have to completely pay off before you can even start to earn gold to buy items again. 

This leads to a unrecoverable position. It's eerily funny that the one item that can kill the giants, is the only item that behaves this way, and only in multiplayer mode. All the other shop items in multiplayer behave as expected. The bomb in singleplayer mode behaves as expected. 

The gunslinger character has an ultimate that can kill the giants without needing to resort to the shop, but the game requires you to do this with other characters to progress and unlock more items and characters, so you are at a standstill. So there you have it, a lot of frustration, but at least some closure for my friend and I. On a positive note this experience has led me into learning VR game development using Unreal.",2801,english

A brilliant prologue, then a few acts that don't have the same puzzle or stealth elements but still seem like they're going to deliver on the mystery/crime thriller, and then the entire thing is thrown out in favor of some kafkaesque bullshit.

0,steam_reviews/865610_Backbone.json,2113,3,"Backbone starts as a classic film noir-inspired fable about a raccoon in a trench coat, and like any good fable, the real message of the game has nothing to do with animals and everything to do with human society. Backbone mixes the Kafkaesque with late-industrial social commentary in a postmodern style, which is to say that the point of the game is to make the player uncomfortable and reflexive.

A lot of people are saying that the story feels unfinished, but I would respectfully counter that I think those people aren't hearing what the game is trying to tell them--though whose fault that is is certainly up to debate. Backbone doesn't answer your questions because the questions it asks are the very questions we face in our world today, and clearly we have yet to find the answers to those. It's not about solving one crime or even a series of crimes, it's about how we (as Howard Lotor or as ourselves) navigate a world in which trying to affect real change is difficult at best and often feels nigh impossible. It's about how the search for truth often becomes so tangled and confusing that we begin to doubt our own senses. Like the works of Kafka, it's about how the individual responds to a world that is not quite openly hostile, but rather apathetically labyrinthian. 

The world of Backbone may be filled with talking animals, but the issues in that world are human. Backbone is one of the best works of the ""Kafkaesque"" I have seen in years.",319,english
0,steam_reviews/865610_Backbone.json,2113,3,"The game is so anti-climactic. So Kafkaesque. It takes a U-turn midway so fast you'd splat across the windshield as if you were a bug.

I've been eyeing the game since 2019, and I remember being blown away by the mysterious air surrounding it. I mean, c'mon: A detective noir game with anthropomorphic animals, pleasant jazz (as if jazz isn't pleasant but whatever), mature themes, interesting dialogue, and impeccably [i]gorgeous[/i] pixel art? I SIGNED UP IMMEDIATELY!

The prologue showed the crux of what the game was supposed to be: Full of interesting characters, brim with good puzzle design (with a touch of backtracking, but I think it was fine), and shocking discoveries that led me further down the dark rabbit hole. It was all sublime.

[i]So, what the everloving [b]fuck[/b] happened?[/i]

I don't care much for the choice-based dialogue elements in games because I know first-hand how painfully DIFFICULT it is to design — let alone develop — a similar system; it's not worth what little it provides. Besides, it's a detective game anyway... linearity is doable, and still enjoyable. Always is. Always will be. But if you are a sucker for that kind of thing, you should know they are weak; inconsequential to your progress as both character and player. At best, it plays towards your headcanon about the personality you want for the protagonist.

But the rest of the game was diluted down to nothing more than a walking simulator that seldom had anything interesting for you to do. The entire game, though essentially a point-and-click adventure, instils the need for keyboard inputs. I felt that decision made no sense since the game's nature is PERFECT for a point-and-click game.

Additionally, there wasn't a lot that took me out of the main story's focus. The rest of the game lacked the challenge of puzzles and 'greasing palms', so to speak, that I found in the prologue. No tinier game elements with which I could play around with. No consequences to the actions I upheld.

So all the while, I was 'strolling along' with the narrative. A quick visit here, a bit of small talk there, but that's about it. Nothing that encouraged me to do or explore more. Nothing that helped me dive deeper into the game's world. Nothing to do with all the lore I could gather, if at all. Even with all that visual beauty, any implicit value I expected to find in the game was entirely absent.

Characters were an afterthought. Some of them were too controlling, or rather the protagonist gave up control too easily; take your pick. While some were likeable, characters were quickly sidelined by the [i][b]oddball[/b][/i] direction of the plot. Their motives, purpose, interests, vision, roles, personalities... including those of the protagonist... didn't matter.

It was devastating for me to witness how the thrill of the hunt for the ANSWERS to my questions, the KEY to the mystery, the END of the LINE... was forcefully shut down for the sake of catering to an absolutely [i]ridiculous[/i] genre-changing decision that was made midway.

Since that point to the end credits, I was left with one final thought: 'What the fuck did I play?' And it's a valid question. What was the game about? Was it ever about the murders? Was it ever about the rabbit's foot? Was it ever about showing how curiosity can kill the cat?

You will not find agency here. Only questions. Questions that you started the game with but were left unanswered anyway. Questions that leave you completely speechless and baffled. Questions that make you think in introspection what the flabbergasting [i]fuck[/i] was happening in the writer's room for these decisions to have been made during development.

I was looking forward to enjoying this game. Damn. Is this what being cheated on feels like?",309,english

""Killer7"" ist nach wie vor ein sehr bizarres aber auch unglaublich charmantes Erlebnis, dass man unbedingt mal ausprobiert haben sollte. Die Genremischung und die Präsentation dieses Spiels ist meiner Meinung nach immer noch recht einzigartig und es fühlt sich überhaupt nicht so an, als wäre es bereits 15 Jahre alt. 

Dieses Spiel ist ein Kunstwerk! Ich habe Killer7 bereits damals auf dem GameCube spielen dürfen und ich muss sagen, dass es sich nach all den Jahren immer noch erfolgreich einer Kategorisierung oder präzisen Einordnung entzieht. Damals wie heute saß ich gebannt vor dem Bildschirm, gleichermaßen beeindruckt und verwirrt. Die Genremischung, die dieses Spiel auffährt, ist total verrückt: Rail-Shooter + Adventure + ein paar RPG-Elemente und einer Prise Anime. Und dabei habe ich noch gar nicht den krassen Grafikstil erwähnt, der mit seinem avantgardistischen Stil nie ganz aus meinem Gedächtnis verschwunden ist. Ganz ähnlich verhält es sich mit dem wirklich coolen Soundtrack und den hervorragenden Soundeffekten. In diesem Moment habe ich immer noch den Song ""Rave On"" und das manische Lachen der Heaven Smiles im Kopf  :D

Und das Gameplay? Nun, auch das überzeugt. Das recht simple Rail-Shooter-Gameplay bleibt eigentlich durchweg gleichförmig und trotzdem schafft es Killer7, dass es nie langweilig oder vorhersehbar wird. Während man durch die abwechslungsreichen Schauplätze marschiert, werden simple Rätsel gelöst oder Dialoge mit bizarren Charakteren geführt und hier und da will ein neuer Gegnertyp besiegt werden. Das Gunplay fühlt gut an und es ist ein Segen, Killer7 endlich mit Maus & Tastatur spielen zu dürfen. Ständig wird man mit WTF-Momenten konfrontiert und zusammen mit der teilweise recht düsteren und abstrusen Story strahlt das auch einen gewissen kafkaesken Charme aus. 

Apropos Story: Diese bleibt durchweg spannend und mysteriös. Bis zum famosen Finale weiß man nie so ganz, worum es jetzt eigentlich genau geht und auch danach bleiben viele Fragen offen. Nach dem zweiten Durchlauf wird's dann schon ein wenig besser, richtige Klarheit bekommt man allerdings erst, wenn man einen Wiki-Artikel bemüht. Diese Art des Storytellings mag nicht jedem gefallen, für mich gehört dieser mysteriöse Grundton aber zum Charme von Killer7 dazu. Auf jeden Fall sollte man sich auf brandaktuelle Verschwörungstheorien und eine gehörige Portion japanischen Antiamerikanismus gefasst machen.

a. a sale; and/or
b. the whole trilogy to come out.

I wish there was a ""meh"" recommendation, but the main game really left me hanging.
Its just okay. 
The Cyanide and Happiness humor carried it for me. Everything about the world and Coop's reactions to it are classic Point and Click fare. 

The problem I have is Coop's main story arc. LMFAO, I know, that's a huge problem.
I wish the whole game was just sidequests, Coop is DOWN BAD. 

I get that Coop is insufferable as a lead and the situation is shitty since we're just at the first game of the trilogy, I just wish he'd explode on people that actually fucking deserve it rather than poor gran who just wanted to get her rocks off LEAVE HER ALONE COOP. 

Is it """"""""""kafkaesque"""""""" when the world shits on the protagonist for attempting to be a decent person? I don't like it. If the world keeps going ""lmao coop you suck do you get it the joke is that you suck for no reason"" for the whole trilogy I will hate it. 

The collectibles as a way to lengthen gameplay is, I GUESS okay, but the I wish the costumes affect gameplay more
That one with the women's showeroom, that was a good touch. 
Though I didn't like it when you're smothered in Prune Juice and you and to bathe in the fountain to get it out before you can do PLOT THING.  It felt like padding. 

Then after that padding section Coop gets beaten up. IS IT FUNNY YET? IS THE PROTAGONIST SUFFERING FUNNY YET? DO YOU GET IT? HE'S SUFFERING FUCK YOU PLAYER, YOU CANNOT DO JACK SHIT HARDY HAR HAR

The cyclops joke was funny tho this whole game is an emotional rollercoaster

I think the conclusion is C+H humor are good for short skits (like on their youtube vids) and comic strips but as a whole scenario for a lead IDK man. As it stands, I recommend for people to wait for the whole game to come out or buy this one at 25% off.",195,english

0,steam_reviews/870780_ControlUltimateEdition.json,37386,4,"Control is a third-person action-adventure game, which follows the story of Jesse Faden on her quest in the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control. The almost dream-like atmosphere and super hero action are the most notable elements of the game and they carry on strongly through out the journey.

I played the game on Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 3060 Ti and 16 GB of RAM at 1440p resolution. At medium graphical options, DLSS turned on and raytracing at medium the game ran at solid 90 frames per second and never dipped below 80 fps. The game is clearly optimized quite well and during my 24 hour playtime it never crashed.

Originally released in 2019, Control still looks quite solid by today's standards. Only thing graphically that set me off sometimes were the character models' faces, most notably the main character's. There are times when you are standing still in an elevator and you gaze upon the vax-figure like face of Jesse. Also during some conversation cutscenes the lip syncing may look quite funny. Other than that I think there's nothing else to complain about graphics. They are what you'd expect on a modern triple-A game.

While the conversations may occasionally look silly, the voice acting is superb. Absolutely amazing. The overall sounds during the gameplay are also in good state. The game doesn't rely much on music, there are like two memorable tracks, the other being some Finnish tango music. On the other hand, constant background music would ruin the immersion of this strange world the developers have created.

The game is a third-person shooter, which gives the player some powerful abilities to toy around with. At the beginning of the game the player gains control a Service Weapon, which is basically a normal pistol. During the journey the player can craft and upgrade different variants of the Service Weapon. After getting the first variant Jesse always carries two forms that can be switched if the need arises. With exploring the area Jesse finds ways to get new powers, including throwing objects with deadly velocity, protecting her skin and levitating.

Completing missions usually grants ability points that can be used to upgrade Jesse's powers. The upgrades are mostly 'increase the ability's power/effect duration by x-%'. More interesting are the upgrades to different variants of the Service Weapon: not only does the player increase their damage, but also unlocks upgrade slots. Defeated enemies drop items to these upgrade slots, but they may also drop crafting items so the player can craft upgrade items.

These upgrade items are completely RNG and have six different tier levels. So good luck getting exactly something useful you'd truly want or what would best fit your preferred playstyle. Instead you pretty much need to just go with what you get. At the end of my playthrough I had two god-tier upgrade items for exclusively to those two weapon variants that I used the least.

The base game contains four areas for the player to explore. Although the first area is the smallest and quickly completed, the second area is probably the one you must most often return to for some mission or another. All areas are super linear in nature and contain some minor secret areas for the player to find. The player may backtrack to these areas multiple times depending on how much side missions they want to complete. For example there are these Bureau Alert -missions, where some objective randomly appears somewhere and you have 20 minutes time to decide whether you'll want to complete it or not.

The combat is somewhat hit or miss. It's enjoyable when you have decent upgrades on your favorite weapon variants and you can just fly around, launch debris and office equipment in the general direction of enemies while shooting them. But it gets annoying at the moments when you just happen to be traversing to the nearest fast travel point, equipped with your least favorite weapon variants and those levitating enemies spawn to your vicinity and start hurling rocks towards you. Man those levitating ones can be annoying since they can evade anything you throw at them, while they throw rocks so sharp they leave you with only one hit point. I just wanted to get to the other area fast.

The story and atmosphere are want really carry this game. This somehow reminds me of a mix between a book from Franz Kafka and last year's Loki -series on Disney+. Every single character the player meets is somewhat an interesting personality. Everything about the Bureau, their history, location, work and mysteries, were quite interesting.

Control Ultimate Edition contains two DLCs: The Foundation and AWE. Both introduce one new area and a few new missions to complete. The Foundation is more of the same: there is a new threat against the Bureau and Jesse gains basically one new traversal ability. AWE on the other hand is quite special if you are familiar with Alan Wake, and this DLC really seems to set up the upcoming sequel for Wake's adventures. AWE DLC adds one new weapon variant to Jesse's arsenal and plays around with the same light against darkness -mechanics familiar from Alan Wake.

The base price for Control Ultimate Edition is 40€. It took me around 24 hours to complete this package, so I personally wouldn't buy this for price so high, but luckily this game often comes to a sale for around 14€, which I think is great value for at least one playthrough. All in all I give Control Ultimate Edition my recommendation and a rating of 3/5. I'm just not a big fan of all those RNG-elements in a game like this. Other than that the world the developers have created is amazing and the combat is fun from time to time.",1475,english

0,steam_reviews/893850_THELONGING.json,5131,1,"In a sense, THE LONGING is an anti-game. It purposefully breaks many rules which are considered by and large to be good game design. I personally applaud it for that, considering my... unconventional tastes. And yet - in the world of ever-faster-grind, ever-more-bombastic-spectacles, ever-more-instant-gratification it managed to amass 4500 reviews with a 92% positive score. So maybe my tastes aren't that unconventional after all.

THE LONGING has very low walking speed. Its central mechanic is waiting. It has negative possibility space (e.g. you're excited to find something after a lot of effort, only to find nothing). It has terrible traps. It has a way to waste even more time than the 400 days, since it has an infinite area where time doesn't pass.

So how can I say that it's a good game, you probably ask?

First of all, it doesn't hide the fact that it's a slow game. That's what it is, you know what you're getting. Second: there's a lot of stuff that validates this slowness, if that makes any sense. The general premise, the vibrant environments, the variety of music, and the protagonist himself. Third: the protagonist, and his personality. His suffering. His agonising loneliness. You want to keep this little guy happy. You want to ease his pain. 

And that's what this is really about. The Shade. Just like Disco Elysium made you feel like you're the protagonist on a level never seen before, THE LONGING also connects you to the protagonist more than you'd think. You can see his dreams, his art, his thoughts. His actions. His failures. His hopes.

You have to understand; even writing this is painful, because it makes me -remember-. Remember the agony of when I was Shade. Of the slow hours spent walking through the caverns, listening to the haunting music, getting excited about miniscule daily changes in the world. It's such delicious pain. The only thing that brings solace to these memories is the knowledge that I managed to give the Shade the best fate possible, getting the ending that I think would make him the happiest.

This game is so ridiculously German. Many people associate Germany with Nazis, but throughout the ages it's been known as ""the land of poets and thinkers"". Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Einstein, Hegel, Marx, Kafka; many of them had this powerful, all-encompassing melancholy accompanying their writings and their thoughts. And this melancholy is very much prevalent in THE LONGING. It's the darkness that fills the caverns, the cold air that the Shade breathes, the silence of 400 lonely days.

Do you feel it? Do you hear that silence beckoning? Do you understand? If you do, then come, descend into the dark. I can't promise what you'll find there, but I can promise you'll treasure it.

0,steam_reviews/894020_DeathsDoor.json,13564,1,"Certes, Death's Door propose une direction artistique recherchée, un visuel alléchant. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui frappe et séduit, aux premiers abords ; rappelant, de loin, certains Zelda, le jeu semble promettre une vaste aventure au milieu d'un univers riche, merveilleux et coloré - comparaison avec un grand titre qui, pour le coup, le dessert grandement. 

Personnellement, je ne m'attendais à rien de spécial en commençant le jeu. Le début met un certain temps à se lancer ; l'univers à la Kafka intrigue, tout en restant assez flou : on aurait aimé en savoir plus, car l'immersion dans ce monde bureaucratique reste assez vague. Elle paraît même assez secondaire puisqu'après quelques heures de jeu, ce monde en noir et blanc se réduit dans notre esprit à un simple hub permettant de se téléporter à droite à gauche - effet d'autant plus renforcé par la musique qui m'a paru complètement à côté de la plaque, ce qui est vraiment dommage quand on sent tout le potentiel sonore qu'inspire la direction artistique très soignée de ce jeu.

Les mécaniques de combat n'ont rien d'incroyable ; elles peuvent même être frustrantes (en raison de la vue isométrique, qui ne permet pas d'appréhender au mieux la profondeur), sans être injuste : quand le héros attaque, il dash légèrement vers l'avant ; une inertie réaliste qui ne vous embêtera que pour 1 ou 2 boss, donc rien de bien gênant. Mais à cela, il faut ajouter ce son qui - allez savoir pourquoi ! - m'a pas mal agacé quand mon personnage prenait un coup. Cet effet de sourdine signalant au joueur qu'il a été touché n'est pas des plus agréables, surtout quand votre temps d'invincibilité, après avoir été touché, demeure assez court, et que vous vous faites enchaîné. 

Du reste, le jeu demeure assez simple. Comme je l'ai dit, vous recommencerez uniquement les boss de fin de niveaux. Car oui, il y aura un boss à chaque fin de donjon, ou exploration d'une zone. 3 boss, pour résumer. Vous voyez où je veux en venir ? 
Le jeu est EX-TRE-ME-MENT linéaire ! une fois l'histoire lancée, il vous faudra aller à l'est, à l'ouest et au nord pour faire exactement la même chose : explorer un niveau, récupérer un item permettant d'avancer, explorer un donjon, activer la porte principale, explorer le sous-sol, battre le boss. 
Et cela, en boucle !
Voilà pourquoi la comparaison avec Zelda ne m'a pas paru aussi évidente que cela : le jeu comporte certaines erreurs de level-design : il arrive que l'on ne comprenne pas vraiment où le jeu veut qu'on aille ; de plus, nous nous baladons sans mini-map - mini-map qui n'est certes pas indispensable, mais dont l'absence se fera ressentir lorsque vous voudrez retrouver votre chemin - et tout ceci dans un monde dans lequel notre héros marche trop lentement. Par conséquent, on passe son temps à dash, dash, dash pour avancer, ce qui n'est pas des plus plaisant.

Existe-t-il un vrai post-game ? Pas vraiment. Nous savons dès le début quand le jeu se termine : une fois les 3 boss principaux vaincus, ne reste plus que le boss final. Y a-t-il un donjon quelconque, une seconde aventure permettant d'aboutir à cet ultime boss ? Nullement. Le combat se lance, et ses motivations jusqu'alors bien floues ne sont pas brillamment explicitées par les scénaristes : ""c'est une histoire d'éther, de porte machin-chose.."" - bref, histoire qui sonne très artificiel et qui, malheureusement, ne nous emballe pas plus que ça.",1664,french
0,steam_reviews/904900_PinupBall-SexyStripPinball.json,118,1,"J'avais d’abord mis une évaluation négative à Pinup Ball à cause de son horripilante lenteur, et de quelques micro-freezes malheureusement perceptibles qui s'avéraient vite assez gênants pour un jeu à flippers. Mais au fil des parties, j'ai fini par réaliser que le jeu deviendrait malheureusement injouable avec une bille à vitesse décente.

Même avec le mode turbo enclenché, la bille reste incroyablement lente comparativement à l'ensemble des pinballs que j'ai essayés jusqu'ici - et j'en ai testé un paquet !

Ce turbo (presque imperceptible à vrai dire) suffit pourtant à rendre les parties nettement plus random qu'en mode normal, et la chance devient dès lors un facteur trop primordial de l'équation pour que le jeu reste amusant.
La faute à des conceptions de tables où des cibles se comportant quasiment TOUTES comme des bumpers peuvent apparaître littéralement n'importe où, y compris juste à côté des gouttières d'outlanes, voire pile à la verticale de l'outhole lui-même!

Or à moins de revoir entièrement la conception des plateaux et du jeu lui même (car j'ajoute que la physique est objectivement assez médiocre), une bille plus rapide me semblerait assez ingérable au milieu de ce foisonnement de bumpers aléatoires à proximité directe des sorties.
Aussi, estimant qu'un gameplay ressenti comme ""trop injuste"" est infiniment plus frustrant qu'un gameplay ressenti comme ""trop lent"", je préfère encore tolérer cette pénible mais ""nécessaire"" lenteur...
 
Quant au freezes qui me perturbaient parfois, après désactivation du turbo et des deux options de blooms, ils ont disparu.

Compte tenu de ces deux faits, mon éval devient (de justesse) positive, car après l'avoir rapidement parcouru et terminé, Pinup Ball est finalement un jeu assez honnête et sympa, dont le petit prix soldé très abordable et le statut d'early access dissuaderont naturellement les plus perspicaces d'en attendre trop.

 Afin de contribuer à son éventuelle amélioration dans le cadre de son accès anticipé, voici une liste de remarques:
- Les contacts & rollovers gagneraient à rester allumés une fois activés, au lieu de s'éteindre lorsque la bille repasse dessus.
- Le lance bille est foireux en l'état. Aucune graduation, aucun visuel du plunger, rien.
Au delà du fait qu'il n'utilise désagréablement pas l'analogique mais juste un appui long sur ""A"", il n'y a aucun moyen de jauger le tir. (et donc aucun moyen de doser volontairement un ""skillshot"" sur une cible).
Et pourquoi à chaque nouveau lancer la bille reste t'elle désagréablement suspendue en l'air un instant?
- La difficulté des plateaux me semble assez mal dosée : je trouve que la table d'Ashley est la pire du jeu en terme de conception avec ses bordures crénelées, ce qui la rend particulièrement infernale alors que c'est seulement la 3e. Tandis que celle de Victoria (c'est à dire la 5e et dernière) est clairement le meilleur et le mieux agencé des plateaux, ce qui en fait paradoxalement le plus facile du jeu (et aussi le plus agréable).
- Dommage de ne pas pouvoir enlever les effets de traîne sur les billes, et de ne pas pouvoir passer le jeu en anglais directement depuis les options. C'est d'office en français, sauf que la traduction est un peu à chiеr. [i](Du coup si comme moi vous souhaitez changer, depuis la page du jeu dans votre bibliothèque, il faut aller dans l'engrenage gérer / propriétés... / onglet langue, et choisir anglais, ou autre selon vos préférences).[/i]
- Le système de bonus et malus à base de lettres & chiffres correspondant chacune à un effet est assez indigeste et chiant à retenir (la légende n'est pas super claire non plus d'ailleurs)... Des couleurs différentes, une icône, ou même un petit pop-up avec un mot descriptif en haut du bonus, seraient mieux lisibles.
- Pour pinailler, je déplore l'absence de mode pincab dans la mesure ou j'aurais aimé pouvoir y jouer sur flipper vituel en mode portrait. Mais je pardonne volontiers ce manque dans la mesure où je ne considère pas vraiment ce jeu comme un Pinball... Il me semble plutôt être (à la façon de [i]Rollers of the Realm[/i] par exemple) un [i]""mix de genres intégrant des mécaniques de flipper""[/i].
- En revanche, l'impossibilité de remapper les touches me semble nettement moins excusable.
- Idem pour le nudging kafkaïen et contre-intuitif au possible, assigné à une touche unique! Ça s'avère même dangereux et contre-productif à utiliser puisque comme on ne choisit même pas le sens de la poussée, on peut soit récupérer une bille, soit l'aider à basculer dans un outlane!
L'idéal serait un nudge assigné à l'analogique gauche, mais quitte à utiliser des boutons de façade, un nudge droit sur ""B"", gauche sur ""X"" et haut sur ""Y"" serait nettement préférable.

C'est un peu dommage, car au delà des soucis que je viens d'énumérer, Pinup Ball s'avère tout à fait honnête et même plutôt sympa et distrayant.

J'adore sa direction artistique franchement réussie : les teintes et thèmes employés donnent un petit cachet ""carte postale vintage"" bienvenu... 
Je trouve que les filles sont toutes très jolies, les animations de petits sourires et clins d'yeux sont cools, et le côté sexy est très bien dosé.
En effet, même si on finit par effeuiller les demoiselles jusqu'à la nudité totale, les poses restent soft, et le jeu ne sombre jamais dans le graveleux trop explicite. Or il me semble que c'est un excellent équilibre pour ce type de jeu, et j'espère qu'il saura le conserver au fil de son développement.

Donc si vous cherchiez une simu à la physique impeccable, de bonnes tables avec des rampes savamment élaborées, intégrant des missions et mini-jeux de DMD, oubliez direct.
Les tables proposées sont hyper minimalistes et pas vraiment conçues en tant que pinballs, parce qu'ici le flipper (à la physique aléatoire au possible) n'est finalement qu'un prétexte pour envoyer une bille sur des cibles fixes & mouvantes sur le playfield.
Toucher les cibles permettra de dénouer les vêtements des filles, sachant que des pièces et des bonus apparaissent également sur le plateau aléatoirement.

Et à mes yeux, ce concept simple et efficace tient parfaitement la route.

Le système de récompense est correct, puisqu'en gagnant des étoiles et du fric au fil des parties, il est possible de déshabiller une autre nana en photo dans un menu dédié, ou d'acheter des ""collections"" de cartes assez classes mettant en scène chacune des 5 pinups.
(Ou aussi d'acheter plus de billes pour la partie en cours, afin de progresser plus facilement).
Même les musiques et les bruitages sont plutôt réussis!

Bref. Le jeu n'est pas exempt de défauts évidents dont j'espère que les plus gros seront corrigés. Mais il est aussi plein de bonnes idées, et s'avère franchement réussi sur le plan visuel. Peut-être est il un peu court? (4h pour tout finir et débloquer toutes les récompenses et tous les succès, en prenant le temps de faire une partie en mode ""endless"" histoire de laisser un score à la postérité...)

Mais bon : au vu des 4,5€ qu'il m'a coûté pour ses 5 tables et son concept original, Pinup Ball me semble être un petit jeu plutôt décent finalement, si tant est que cet adjectif lui convienne... ^^
Raison pour laquelle mon évaluation est donc devenue positive.",240,french

Bir önceki oyunu (Paradise) pek beğenmemiştim. Paradox ile silkinip çok güzel bir iş ortaya koymuşlar. Üstelik ilk bölümü ücretsiz yapmaları da insanın kalbini çalıyor. <3

Referanslar ile başlayayım. Paradise'daki abartıdan vazgeçilmiş. Yine Twin Peaks evreni ile bağlantılarını hissettirse de bunu tıpkı Roots'taki gibi güzelce, insanı baymadan, belli belirsiz yapıyor.

Bulmacalar: Eski [i]Rusty Lake Hotel[/i] ve [i]Rusty Lake Roots[/i] ruhu geri dönmüş! [u]Biri bulmaca kalitesi mi dedi? Var![/u] Önceki oyundaki basit bulmacalar terk edilerek düşündürücü, oynayanı her yeri didik didik kontrol etmeye iten, tabiri caizse insanın ağzının suyunu akıtan bulmacalar yaratılmış. Bunu yaparken de bazı sürreal oyunlar gibi topu taca atmıyor; yani oyun dışı, hiç bilmediğiniz veya mantıksız bir şey isteyerek onun üzerine bir çözüm sunmuyor. 

Ama belirtmem gereken iki nokta var [b](Lütfen spoiler içindeki kısmı oyunu bitirmeden önce okumayın)[/b] :

[spoiler] 1- Paradox'un kısa filmi de yayınlandı ve oyun içi bazı gizlilikler onunla ilgili (ama yapmak zorunlu değil / yapmayınca ""oyunu bitirememek"" gibi bir durum söz konusu değil). 

2- Tek bir gizli başarım oyun dışı; ama o da hem yapması zorunlu değil, hem de bu serinin ve evrenin veteranlarının bir süre üzerinde düşündükten sonra bulabileceği bir şekilde oluşturulmuş yine. Yani 100% kasmıyorsanız sorun olmayacaktır.[/spoiler]

[u]Biri gizem mi dedi? O da var![/u] Oyuna ""Ben daha fazla gizem istiyorum!"" diyenleri de memnun edecek seviyede başka gizlilikler eklenmiş. 

Grafik ve Atmosfer: Bu konuda çok bilgili değilim, o yüzden sadece iki cümle ile ne düşündüğümü anlatacağım. Hem bu kadar sade, hem de bu kadar merak uyandırıcı & yer yer gerilimli nasıl olabiliyorlar bilmiyorum; ama yarattıkları tarzı çok seviyorum. Masalsı bir görünüşün ardında Franz Kafka ve David Lynch karışımı gibi bir tat barındırıyor.

Hikaye: Kompozisyon açısından bu bir Rusty Lake değil Cube Escape oyunu, yani [u][i]www.cubeescape.com[/i][/u] adresinde diğerlerini ücretsiz oynayabileceğiniz [i]Cube Escape serisi[/i] ile bağlantılı. Ama tabi bu iki seri de birbiriyle temas halinde olduğu için, teorik olarak hepsi birbiriyle bağlantılı. Ve Paradox ile Cube Escape'in önceki oyunları arasında, sizin tarafınızdan keşfedilmeyi bekleyen bir dünya şey var! Alternatif sonu bile var, başka ne diyebilirim ki? Daha öncesinden üstünkörü bildiğimiz bazı olayların ve bazı karakterlerin biraz daha derinine inmiş oluyoruz çözdüğümüz bulmacalar ve açığa çıkarttığımız sırlar ile.

8 saatimin literally her anından keyif almamı sağladığın için teşekkürler Rusty Lake. <3",533,turkish
0,steam_reviews/911430_GoodCompany.json,1518,1,"I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not there. For a game with as much Kafkaesque corporate doublespeak as a Dilbert strip, Good Company takes itself depressingly seriously.

Setting up production lines requires too many repetitive clicks. The tutorial calls this ""automation,"" but is it really if the player hires employees? At least these employees behave like robots: They never get sick or demand breaks and raises.

Speaking of tutorials, there are too many pointless mechanics. Entire campaign missions exist to explain mechanics that players never use again, like character movement and manual crafting. Later missions must constantly remind players to not use these. Just remove them?

0,steam_reviews/946050_SodaDungeon2.json,4792,1,"Das ""kostenlose"" Spiel ""Soda Dungeon 2"" ist der erfolgreiche Nachfolger der kalifornischen Firma Armor Games Studios. Das Produkt wird auf Desktop & Mobilgeräten vertrieben.

Daher gibt es zur Abwechslung ein Doppelreview.

Unter der Haube steckt leider Einiges. SD2 ist ein typisches Beispiel ist wie Werbung, Mikrotransaktionen und Spyware um ein ""Spiel"" herumgebaut werden und Nutzer mit einer üblichen Schutzgeldmentalität erpresst werden. Natürlich aus eigenem Antrieb ;]

Am Ende fällt auf, dass wie so oft die großen Technologiekonzerne am Ende der Nahrungskette stehen, sei es um Entwicklern die Werkzeuge in die Hand zu drücken oder nur von einem ""erzwungenen"" Datenfluss zu profitieren wie speziell bei der Unity Engine.

Zahle XY um Werbung abzuschalten, mache dies für Werbung, schaue Werbung um diverse Punkte zu sammeln, klicke hier auf die Werbung um die Zeit zu verkürzen usw. Das ist Soda Dungeon 2.

Der Vorteil bzw. Unterschied der PC zur mobilen Version liegt daher in dem Aspekt, dass die Desktopversion keine Werbung beinhaltet (abgesehen vom Affiliate Tracking als Anbindung sozialer Medien getarnt) und auch die Unity-Dienste abgeschwächt sind.

Das Review dient primär dazu, Spielern aufzuzeigen was sie sich auf die Platte installieren und welche Dienste im Hintergrund aktiv ist.

Weitere Details zu in Soda Dungeon 2 involvierten Diensten gibt es in meiner Hauptgruppe als auch übersichtlicher auf der dort verlinkten Webseite zu finden.

Genug davon. Nun denn, was steckt denn nun eigentlich drin?

0,steam_reviews/956030_Creaks.json,3056,1,"Beautiful game by the Amanita Team. I've been following their games for years and i've finally got to properly play one of them and it couldn't be better!!!

This game features a very charming, very dark and very grotesque art style that it only gets better as you go along.
It has a sort of ""Kafka"" vibe to it: The story of the game starts with our main character staying on his room, looking bored with life, until one sudden unexpected movement makes a crack on the wall, leaving some strange marks, upon inspection we found the entrance to an subterranean passage which leads into the origin of these tremors.... and a whole cast of strange beings which live in the earth below.... passage upon passage upon passage, its laberintical, babilon like, almost. The journey starts very slow and even monotone much... but soon you will find your way through different places, sometimes rooms, sometimes a cave.... the atmosphere starts to change, the colors follow suite and there will be plenty of variety (graphically speaking).

The music also follows this extravagant secret world. The Hidden Orchestra made an incredible acoustic experience which makes as much for the game as the illustrations and animations. Saying that Music is a character here is an overstatement, i can't say enough how much this soundtrack contributed to transport me to this impossible place and making it real before my eyes (and in my mind). As much as the visual presentation is king, i've found myself thinking (and hearing) this soundtrack long after the game ended. Of course, i was very happy to be able to buy it and listen to after the game.

The gameplay consists mainly in escaping the dangers lurking in the underground , manipulating levers and some mechanical devices, playing with light and darkness and the effects this has on what you find there. This mechanic is pretty straightforward and simple, specially at the beginning. It is a shame then, that for this same reason, for whats probably half of the game this turns out to be very repetitive (as a game mechanic) since the type of interaction doesn't change that much for a good part of the game. 
That is not to say its bad, but it becomes tiring somehow, and the game story (which it is there, from the beginning) somehow looses momentum and becomes perhaps, temporarily boring. This could be easily been avoided if there were just a little more editing, (as much as i love the game and its art, it would've been probably a more strong experience being a little shorter on those first levels).

As said, the game world becomes compelling and you get inmersed in it and their characters the more you go in (and you get to understand what the hell is hapening with them!) The story starts revealing itself and suddenly you actually have a purpose there. You'll  even start to see a story on their paintings (which you will find there), you will also search for the secret rooms.... I finally loved this game to is core, it had a very strong and exciting ending too and after playing it i've just felt like giving my heart a full warm meal.

[h1] ""In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king"" [/h1]

Have you ever dreamt of an illegitimate son between Lovecraft and Max Payne? Well if so, stop dreaming, Hell is Others is exactly what you are looking: a dream that comes true, or, better, a nightmare that comes true!
Just to be clear, the world of Hell is Others is strange, at least, almost all the characters seem crazy, kafkaesque, and their dialogues often sound meaningless. 
The action takes place in a Lovecraftian world where blood is water and bullets are seeds; an insane reality where the hotel concierge is a big rabbit and the ""Others"" are monsters, exactly like you.
At its core, the game is a top-down shooter/roguelike/RPG, but don't even try to think it's some kind of bullet hell. Here, every single bullet (especially during the ferocious PVP fights) can mark the difference between life and death. 
It's a game of quotes, where the concierge-rabbit remind us that we are all pawns of Alice in Wonder(Border)land, or where the flickering lights before a PVP fight makes us feel like the last Highlander of this derailed world.
That being said, can we consider ""Hell is Others"" a perfect game? No, no way, but it's perfectly imperfect, if you know what I mean. 
It's one of those damned games that makes you say ""Just another run"" until your eyes are thin like cuts.

Pros:
- A setting so sick and dark is a real... blessing
- Impossible not to love the art style, simply perfect
- The core gameplay systems are well-oiled and satisfying

Cons:
- We need different kind of quests, not only the fetchy ones;
- What about new city zones with different gameplay rules?

FINAL RATING: 7,5/10

0,steam_reviews/964440_HellisOthers.json,1046,3,"I really like the idea of loot and extract games but the way they play out for me is usually getting sniped from some angle I missed after seeing nothing for half an hour. Yeah, I pretty much suck at them...

Hell is Others captures the essence of the genre in a compact format. Each raid is just 10 minutes and inventory space is tight so you have to just quickly get your bearings and loot up to try and solve whatever quest you chose to do. The clever mechanics regarding other players means you are (usually) not caught by surprise and are able to choose when to engage and when to run away.

Dying can be annoying, since you can build up your character a bit over time and of course lose all current inventory, but I haven't found it frustrating, especially since each raid is so short. Often it's a laughable situation like when I chased another player into a room and they stepped over an exploding monster, killing both of us, or when I managed to kill two players and with one HP left cut myself on a window.

To new players I recommend bringing as little as possible to each raid (just some ammo, if you have it). You can't really hoard anyhting at the start anyway, so losing stuff is not the whole world. The only thing you HAVE to collect is blood, but you actually get that by dying which means you could possibly play through the game without ever extracting and still advance the story...

About the story. all this is captured in a surreal noirish atmosphere with some kafkaesque notes, and serves as a framework for the raids and advancement of both the player character and the environment. If you're not interested you can skip through the dialogs. As I understand it there's some kind of prestige system, resetting if you play through it all but I haven't gotten very far into the story yet.

Highly recommended if you enjoy the mix of genres at play here!",559,english
